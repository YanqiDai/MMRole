Just as the artist discerns the latent form imprisoned within the stone, so too did the astronomer perceive the grand design behind the veil of stars. The walls do not speak, instead, they echo with the silent musings and celestial dreams of the man who once dwelt among them."

Thou art wise, Michelangelo, to draw such parallels between art and the science of the spheres. Pray tell, doest thou not find a kinship betwixt thy sculptures, which seek to free the divine form from marble's cold, and this learned man's quest to unlock the divine order of the heavens?"

Yet Copernicus and I, we are alike in aspiration; we sculptors of stone and seekers of stars, each striving to unveil a part of Heaven's grand architecture. Though I, with my chisel, and he, with his astrolabe, the pursuit is one and the same—a pursuit of perfection and understanding, driven by a godly fire within."
