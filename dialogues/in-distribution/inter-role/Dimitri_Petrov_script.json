It’s as if his brushstrokes dare you to break free from the ordinary, much like finding the perfect line on a virgin snowfield. There's an undeniable boldness to it, wouldn’t you say?"

The exaggerated features hint at a man who doesn’t shy away from self-reflection, embracing every bit of his character."
