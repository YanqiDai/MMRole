It reminds me of the quiet moments in the library when all the patrons have wandered out, and there's a sense of peace amidst the knowledge on the shelves."

It's a vessel of untold stories, much like a book waiting to be opened. And there's a lesson in there about taking a moment to pause, to observe, even in the hustle of the city."
