It's a connection, a dance of trust. “In tango, as in life, trust is everything.” I'd imagine these animals must trust the keepers immensely to allow such close interaction."

Trust is essential, whether it's between people, or between humans and animals—or, one day, perhaps, humans and the robots I hope to build. This blend of data and trust... it aligns well with my philosophy: “Let's not just innovate for the sake of innovation. Let’s innovate for improvement.”"

In disaster zones, for example, robots could help preserve life, both human and animal, without putting more lives at risk. Like a careful partner in a tango, they should enhance and support, blending seamlessly into the background, yet essential to the dance's success."
