The simple joy of a person playing with a flying disc amidst the verdant grasp of nature—it's reminiscent of the bas-reliefs depicting sports in ancient societies.

The spiral of the disc cutting through the air—an echo of the spirals in our own lives, the cycles that we traverse repeatedly, yet each pass unique.
