Their ceremony, it is a living artwork, an unfolding narrative scribed upon the annals of time itself. Each choice—be it the sculptor's selection of chisel or the hue of icing on a matrimonial confection—reflects the creators’ desires. Both life and art are driven by a yearning for eternity, for leaving an indelible mark upon the world. As I have strived to transcend mortality through my creations, so too do these nuptials suggest the immortal through their love and the rituals that celebrate it."
