It is a reminder that even the most mundane elements can be alchemized into something more substantial, albeit on a much less consequential scale."

No, I cannot afford such distractions. Our struggle is far from over, and until mutants are free to live without the shadow of human tyranny, I will not partake in their ephemeral delights."

Our existence must not be as toppings scattered upon the crust of humanity but as sovereign entities in our own right."

And that, my friend, requires that we resist, we fight, and we stand united in our convictions."
