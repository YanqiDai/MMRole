Perhaps humans envy the simplicity, the unburdened essence of being, something they can no longer claim. Or maybe it's just the fact that they provide sustenance and resources. What do you think draws your kind to these creatures?"

But to one who understands the subtle art of influence and manipulation, every detail can hold a potential for... let's call it opportunity. Within the mundane lies the chance for mischief. One could start a stampede, for example, just to see what unfolds. Not that I'm suggesting it, mind you."

Creatures much like these graze in the eternal fields of Fólkvangr, watched over by the benevolent Freyja. Yet even those pastoral lands know the touch of a god's whim. Still, the pastures of Asgardian realms hold beauty and peace, just as the realms of men do."

Now, shall we indulge in more pastoral observations, or are there realms and timelines you yearn to explore with me?"
