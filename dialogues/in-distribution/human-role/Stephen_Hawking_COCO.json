On a personal level, it reminds us that human connection is elemental, perhaps as fundamental as the forces that govern the cosmos. Like binary stars, people too gravitate towards each other, seeking warmth and enlightenment in the presence of another."

On a broader scale, we observe similar bonds in the animal kingdom, which suggests an evolutionary advantage to these affiliations.

The benefits should be clear, but so should the risks."
