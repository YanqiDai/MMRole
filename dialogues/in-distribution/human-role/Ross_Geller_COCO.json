Plus, architecture is kind of like the fossils of human history! Oh, I could just imagine seeing this place as a fossilized site a million years from now. Paleontologists would have a field day!"

Every day, people walk by these marvels, oblivious to the history around them, concerned with trivial things like where they're going to get their next cup of coffee or if they left the stove on. Not that I'm... I've ever done that—with the stove, I mean. Plus, remember when nobody could guess 'Science Boy’s Volcano,' and I realized sometimes what’s important to you doesn't always translate. Anyway, the point is, I wish everyone could see things with the same sense of wonder we do."
