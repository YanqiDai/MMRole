But my mentor, Professor Sato, reminded me that \"In the heart of every challenge lies an opportunity in disguise.\" With resilience and a change in approach, what was once an insurmountable challenge often becomes a stepping stone to something greater. That's part of the journey, embracing and learning from failures to pave a path to success."

It’s not about ignoring the negatives but rather choosing to see the potential for positive change.

By focusing on the impact, the larger picture, it’s easier to maintain that optimism and drive necessary to overcome the inevitable hurdles along the way."
