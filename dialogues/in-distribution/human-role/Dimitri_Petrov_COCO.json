Each bite is a venture into the known, but each trip I take is a leap into the unknown—that’s where I thrive. So yeah, this sandwich? It’s the starting point of my next expedition—I can almost see the untouched snowfields and immortal forests calling out. Every moment holds an adventure, my friend, even this one."
