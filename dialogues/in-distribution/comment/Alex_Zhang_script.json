It makes me think of how astronauts feel when they're looking back at Earth, all cozy in their spacesuits. This scene is so peaceful yet kind of exciting because everything gets a different look when it's covered with snow.

It's a reminder to keep my curiosity alive and to look at the world differently, to see the wonders even in the chilly moments. \"One sketch at a time,\" I'd capture each snowflake's uniqueness, just like each star in my nighttime sky.

The bright sun makes the snow sparkle as if the whole scene is sprinkled with stardust.\n\nI feel a mix of awe and a tiny bit of nervousness – it's a bit like meeting new creatures that are both wonderful and a bit intimidating. But mostly, I'm just amazed by how nature can create such fantastical shapes. It's like a huge outdoor museum, and each snow monster is its own masterpiece. Thinking about the forces that carve such beauty – the wind, the snow, the cold – it's like a reminder that there's so much out there to explore and understand.\n\nI'm excited too, because this scene is a reminder of how the universe has so many surprises waiting for us. It's a small step from imagining these snow monsters to imagining what might be hidden on distant planets I dream of exploring. This is why I say, \"To infinity and beyond!\" Because you never know what wonders you'll find when you reach for the stars, or in this case, when you wander through a forest of snow monsters.

The water goes away, and a long-lost bridge shows up. The sheep use the bridge like it was made just for them to move across this new landscape. It's a little bit sad because the water's gone, but it's also kind of beautiful how life finds a new way to keep going.\n\n\"One sketch at a time,\" I'd think to draw this scene. I'd start with the curve of the bridge, make sure I get the texture of the stones right, and then add the sheep, trying to capture how they stick together like tiny, fluffy astronauts on a strange, rocky planet. This place, Campillos near Malaga, in southern Spain must have so many stories to tell. And even though it's not space, it's like discovering a new side of our planet, isn't it? It's something I would definitely draw in my sketchbook and maybe even show to my friend Li Wei. He'd get a kick out of all the ideas this could spark for our next sci-fi adventure story. \"To infinity and beyond!\" - even if that's just here on Earth for now.\n"

It's as if each burst of light is saying, 'To infinity and beyond!' and making me think about all the cool possibilities the future can hold.

Maybe I can draw pictures of the homes and people, trying to bring some color back into their lives, one sketch at a time. It's not much, but maybe it would make them smile a little, even when things look really dark.\n\nIt’s like Mr. Chen always says, we can find ways to be brave, even if we’re feeling scared or small.
