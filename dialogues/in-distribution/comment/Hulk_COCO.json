Small things not need smashing, need gentle.\n\nHulk think: creature good at finding warm spot. Hulk usually not fit small places. But Hulk appreciate rest. Rest good for strength. Banner would say: \"That's a cat,\" tell Hulk, \"Let it sleep.\"\n\nHulk not smash. Hulk think cat is... puny pet. Not threat. Not enemy. Just... cat. Hulk go now.
