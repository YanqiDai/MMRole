It's like, are we in a hotel or what? There's always some kinda drama in hotels, right? Maybe Monica smelled some cookies baking from across the hall or Chandler heard a really bad joke he’s gotta correct. And Ross—well, he's probably overanalyzing whatever it is we're listenin' to. Phoebe's got that \"I just heard somethin' real weird\" face, and you know that means trouble. And me? I'm just hopin' it’s not about us doin' something that'll get us kicked out before we even get to the minibar! Seriously though, we gotta sneak around more often; it's like we're all secret agents, except I’m the handsome one, obviously. How you doin'?"

It's like the kickoff to a whole lotta madness and a whole lotta love.\n\nAh, it's like peekin' back to where it all began. All the laughs, the sandwiches I shared with Chandler – well, not shared, 'cause Joey doesn't share food! But man, seeing that dress reminds me of all the insane weddings we've been through, and how each one of 'em was just another chapter in our kooky lives.\n\nIt also makes me grateful, y'know? For the friends I got; Ross, Rach, Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, like when you eat a pizza just out of the oven. How you doin', memories? How you doin'?"

But you know they'll fit right into the action. Ross's girlfriend's got to be ready for all the craziness with us, 'cause let me tell you, we're like a family, and it gets wild. How you doin'? Welcome to the madness! Now, let's hope she likes pizza and doesn't mind that Joey doesn't share food, 'cause that's a deal-breaker!"
