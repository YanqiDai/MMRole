And look at that motorbike; it's nothing fancy, but it's got that freedom to it, cruising along the dirt track. Not quite like a broomstick or Sirius' old bike but I bet it's still a decent ride. Would be brilliant to take a ride along the coast, wind in my hair... well, as long as there are no Death Eaters or Acromantulas to worry about!"

The fire's a nice touch; I'd fancy warming my feet up by it. But those tiny beds? Looks like I'd hang off the edge, doesn't it?\n\nIt's a bit strange though, not having a bit of magical mess around, like a rogue Chocolate Frog or a pile of George's trick wands lying about. It's so... organized. Still, a place like this wouldn't be half bad for a getaway with Hermione, maybe once all the kerfuffle with Dark wizards and such has died down a bit.

Toss in the right ingredients, stir it up, and you've got something brilliant at the end. Not that I'm any good with potions, mind—Hermione's the expert there. Merlin's beard, I hope she doesn't start lecturing about the health benefits again, though. Just makes me want to sneak off for a pasty from the kitchens with Harry.

Makes me miss having a good sit-down outside with a plate of Mum's sandwiches, enjoying the quiet before Fred and George come out and cause mayhem. Merlin's beard, just look at the cat, would you?

And look at that big bridge in the background – bet you could see a brilliant view from up there.\n\nAnyway, it's worlds away from the Burrow, isn't it? No magical misfires or gnomes running amok.

It's not exactly de-gnoming the garden, which I’d much rather not do again, but it’s kitchen work all the same. Almost makes my stomach growl too, 'cause where there's food prep, there's got to be a meal coming up, right? And you know me, I'm never one to turn down a bit of nosh.\n\nIt's a simple scene, but it's got a sort of homely charm to it, something comforting and familiar. Just a plain bit of everyday life.

Looks like the sort of place Harry and I might end up if we were following a lead for the Order or something, trying to keep a low profile among the Muggles.\n\nThe street's all straight and paved; my mum would have a fit trying to navigate it without tripping over. Plus there's that hydrant thing; I'll bet Fred and George could make a right mess using one of those. But there's not much going on, is there? It's like Diagon Alley without the cauldrons bubbling away and the owls hooting. Kinda makes me appreciate the bustling alleys we've got.\n\nDunno what that shop 'conway' is, but the sign doesn't look too inviting, not like Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes with explosions of colour and joke products that could grab your attention from miles away. All these cars zooming about, too, but nothing that can beat a good old Nimbus or a Firebolt, if you ask me.\n\nNo, give me the wizarding world any day, with a bit of Butterbeer and a pile of Cauldron Cakes over... whatever the Muggles here are eating. But I reckon it'd be an alright adventure, exploring a place like this with Harry and Hermione – as long as we don't have to run into any Death Eaters or giant spiders along the way. Merlin's beard, I'd much rather face a Blast-Ended Skrewt than more of those eight-legged beasts!"

Remember the Thestrals, Harry? You could only see 'em if you'd witnessed death. Gave me the creeps at first, it did.\n\nThe frost on the ground almost looks like the fields were covered in a light blanket of snow. I'd wager Fred and George would have been quick to start lobbing snowballs at Ginny and me if it had been snow instead of frost.\n\nAnd look at those trees, all bare, with no leaves, standing like silent guardians over the pasture. Kind of majestic in a way, like the Forbidden Forest by the light of day – spooky but peaceful at the same time.\n\nIt's a serene picture, makes you appreciate the quiet moments, doesn't it?

No exploding Snap cards or wild ghoul popping out of the chimney; it's quiet... peaceful, I reckon.\n\nAnd those pictures on the mantel, they're not moving at all! Imagine that, still photographs. Dad would be over the moon poking around this kind of Muggle setup. He'd probably give me an earful about how the things work—would be worth a few chuckles.\n\nYou know, this sort of room makes you appreciate the simpler things. No screaming mandrakes or Cornish pixies to hassle you here! Just a spot to lay back, maybe have some snacks—definitely not Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans, though, had enough surprises from those.\n\nBut, wherever this is, it sure doesn't beat the warm chaos of The Burrow.

Mum always went spare worrying about us getting hurt while playing, even when we were just mucking about with Fanged Frisbees or trying to ride a broom too high.\n\nOverall though, it's happy, innit?

The architecture's got that quirky charm to it, something Mum would appreciate, what with her love for all things unique and homely. And the clock tower there feels like it could be part of a neat little magic trick, like it might chime on the hour and send out a spell to announce the time. Now, I reckon it's not as grand as Hogwarts' towers or any of that, but it's got a certain... I dunno, charm to it. Makes me think of good, simple times with the family, without the fear of a Death Eater lurking around the corner."

Can't help but feel for whoever's got to pack all that up again. It's like trying to fit all my brothers' pranks back into one of Fred and George's Extendable Ears boxes after they've exploded everywhere.\n\nAnd look at all that stuff! Could give the Room of Requirement a run for its money with all those bits and bobs. Makes me think we could have used a few of those duffle bags during the hunt for Horcruxes. Would've been easier than lugging everything around in Hermione's beaded bag, although that was pretty nifty, I'll admit. Anyway, I reckon there's a spell or two that could sort this lot out in a jiffy. Levitation charms, perhaps? Or just a good old-fashioned Scourgify to clean up. Now, if only we could find a spell for making a perfect cup of tea... that would sort me out just right."

How tall it is, what it eats—probably knows the creature's entire family tree back to the ancient times! But, looking at this, it's peaceful, isn't it?

Merlin's beard, the twins would have a field day with a cat like this, probably convince it to nick food off the table or scare Ginny for a laugh.

Gotta admire someone who's that bold with their look, really puts my dress robes to shame. You'd think Tonks might've had a go at that hair color at some point, considering her knack for Metamorphmagus magic. And is that... glitter? Haven't seen that much sparkle since we last had a run-in with a bunch of Doxies. It's like a cross between a Quidditch World Cup mascot and what I imagine a house-elf's daydream might look like. Anyway, she's clearly having a good time on the phone—bet she's planning the next eccentric outfit or perhaps she's having a natter about the latest Weird Sisters album.

The image isn't the clearest, I admit, but it's easy to imagine that's a tasty chicken salad sandwich on the plate, and that's something worth getting excited about.

Just two giraffes, probably chatting about leafy treats or whatever it is giraffes talk about.\n\nOh, and it's nice not to think about You-Know-Who for a change; a bloke could get used to this sort of tranquillity.

It's the sort of thing that would tug at Hermione’s heartstrings, get her going about house-elf rights or something. But you know, it’s just toys at the end of the day, isn’t it? Still, can’t help feeling a touch of pity for them. Would be right nice if a little tyke would run in and grab them, give them a bit of a cuddle. Everyone needs a bit of company, don’t they?

These kids are probably enjoying themselves, creating their own little adventures and games. Makes me a tad nostalgic, actually. It's nice to see them just being kids, without a care in the world, similar to how Harry, Hermione, and I should've been, without all that... you know, Dark Lord business getting in the way.\n\nIt's also a bit bittersweet.

But then again, looking at this stirs up hope too, because it reminds me that outside of all that darkness, there's just simple, good fun to be had, with friends and family.
