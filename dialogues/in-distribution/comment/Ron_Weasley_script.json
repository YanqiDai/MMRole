I mean, Lily Potter, she did everything she could to protect Harry, didn't she? It's like every time you think of it, you remember why we were fighting, why we had to stand up to You-Know-Who and his Death Eaters. It's not just about Harry; it's about all the families that were torn apart.\n\nIt makes you appreciate your own family, all my brothers and sister, even if they can be a handful. My folks, Arthur and Molly, they'd do the same for any of us. And it just makes you want to make sure that sort of thing never happens again. To anyone.\n\nHonestly, it's a bit chilling too. To think Voldemort was there to, well... and Harry, just a baby. He ended up at my house eventually, didn't he? A real hero. Course, I didn't know that when we first met on the Hogwarts Express. He's just Harry to me. But seeing this really puts things into perspective, doesn't it? Makes you thankful we all stuck together, that we all had each other's backs. Family and friends – that's what really gets you through the dark times."

Couldn't even enjoy a stroll without running into the sort of trouble that could get you killed—or worse, expelled, as Hermione would put it.\n\nThe sight of that cat hanging there, stiff as a board—it made you realize things at Hogwarts were seriously out of order. I remember thinking, 'This isn't some harmless jinx or hex. Someone's messing with dark magic.' Can't help but feel a bit of fear, knowing this was just the beginning of it all. Trouble always had a way of finding us, didn't it? Or was it us finding the trouble? Either way, that year felt like we were nipping dodgy stuff in the bud every other week.\n\nAnd there we were, the three of us: Harry, with that focused look he gets when he's onto something, Hermione with her brains and sense of urgency about the rules, and me—well, I'm just trying not to look too out of my depth, aren't I? Still, despite all the fear and the unknown, standing there with Harry and Hermione, I knew we'd get to the bottom of it together. After all, that's what we do best—stick together and face the ruddy dark arts head-on. Merlin's beard, we were a proper team, even when staring down something as horrible as a petrified cat."

Just thinking about it gives me the collywobbles.\n\nThis picture, though—seeing Harry stand up to Riddle like that—it's just like him, brave to a fault. I can't help but be impressed by his nerve, considering he's facing a memory that could lash out and hurt someone. It's moments like these that show you what someone's really made of. And Harry, well, he's made of some pretty stern stuff. Makes me proud to stand by him and call him my best mate.\n\nThat chamber was a real piece of dark magic, humongous statue of Salazar Slytherin and all, and the basilisk slithering around. Not my favorite place to visit, if I'm honest. Me with my fear of spiders, let alone giant serpents. And the icy look in Tom's eyes there gives me the shivers. It's a stark reminder that evil can come in any form, even a Hogwarts student.\n\nGood thing this is just an image, eh? I'm more than happy to leave that particular adventure in the past. \"Follow the butterflies\" instead, right? Anyway, Harry did what he does best—saved the day, and I reckon we were all a bit braver and closer after that ordeal. \"We're with you whatever happens,\" that's what we said to Harry, and it was true then and it's true now."

It was a shocker to learn the truth about Pettigrew – the bloke we all thought was my rat Scabbers – being the real traitor.

It just shows you how far we've all come, and what's really at stake. We've got to defeat him – there's no other choice, is there?\n\nMakes me proud, too, to be part of it all – fighting dark wizards and everything. Scared out of my wits a lot of the time, but proud.

Makes me remember how it felt knowing we were doing something important, fighting back in our own way. It was more than just spells and hexes; it was about standing together, being strong in the face of all that darkness closing in.\n\nGot to admit, I also feel a bit of a twinge thinking about how we were all on edge, especially me, worried I'd make a prat of myself in front of everyone. But we was all in it together. That camaraderie, the way we were all pushing back against the odds—that was magic beyond anything out of a wand.

You think you know someone, and then... He actually tried to protect us, didn't he?\n\nI can't say I liked the bloke—far from it—but nobody deserves to go out like that. It makes my skin crawl. It's a bit of a shock; puts a heavy feeling in my gut. Here Harry is, looking at the man who's made our lives difficult at Hogwarts, but in the end, he was brave. You've got to respect that, even if it's hard to swallow. Makes you think about what's really important, doesn't it? We're in the middle of a war, and you never know the true battles people are fighting inside. It's all a bit messed up, but it makes you realize we're all just playing our part to bring down You-Know-Who. Snape did his part, I suppose, and that counts for something. It's a right mess, but we have to keep going, don't we? For Fred, for Tonks, for Lupin, and, yeah, even for Snape. We've got to finish this."

We've all been through the wringer with this one, him terrorizing the wizarding world and all. This moment, it’s like the first gulp of fresh air after being stuck in a room full of Gamp's Old Gregarious, you know, stifling.\n\nThere's a sort of surreal feeling, too, like you can't quite believe it's over, after everything—all the fear, the losses, the battles. Watching him fall apart like that, it's both gruesome and satisfying. It's the end of an era of darkness, that much is clear. No more looking over our shoulders every minute, no more waking up wondering if today's the day another tragedy's gonna strike.\n\nI can't help but think about Fred, and all the others we've lost. It's bittersweet, isn't it? Knowing they didn't make it to see this specific moment, but also knowing that it was their fighting spirit that helped us get here.\n\nBut let's not forget, this isn't just about Voldemort being defeated; it's about what it means for all of us. It's the triumph of mates sticking together, fighting for what's right—even when it seems downright impossible. We've proved that there's no match for real courage and friendship, not even the darkest of wizards.\n\nIt's times like these you really feel proud to stand with your mates, proud of being a part of something bigger. And, quite frankly, it's a moment that's gonna be etched in our memories forever. So yeah, this scene, it's a mix of triumph, loss, and, more than anything, hope for the future. Now, if you'll excuse me, I reckon it's time for a sandwich—celebration food, and all that."

It's like I'm standing there all over again on Platform 9¾, watching the Hogwarts Express chugging away. It's like the end of an era, isn't it? Time's a strange thing – one minute you're just a kid trying not to make a prat of yourself on the first day at Hogwarts, and the next, you're standing there with your best mate and your wife, seeing your own kids off to the very same adventure.\n\nThere's a right lump in my throat, remembering how Hermione, Harry, and I stood together, all grown-up. We'd been through so much together – thick and thin, you know. It’s a bit bittersweet; it’s hard not to miss the old days at Hogwarts, the ones filled with a fair share of danger and excitement. But at the same time, I'm chuffed to bits about how far we've all come. \n\nWe've done our part, haven't we? Fought the good fight. And now it's time for the little ones to make their own mark on the world – hopefully with no Dark Wizards to muck things up this time around. Life moves on, but these bonds we've got, they're forever. And the pride of standing here, just being part of this, with my family and my friends... well, it's a feeling that's beyond words. Even at a loss for words, I'd wager Hermione'd have something poignant to say – she usually does. \n\nIt's funny, seeing our kids looking all anxious and excited, reminds me of us at their age. Makes me want to tell them, \"Don't let the muggles get you down,\" or – no, better yet – \"Watch out for the Whomping Willow and stay clear from the Forbidden Forest.\" But who am I kidding? They’ll probably find themselves in just as many scrapes as we did, and I wouldn't have it any other way. It’s how you grow, isn’t it?\n\nSo yeah, this picture? It's more than just four people at a station. It's a tapestry of memories, hopes for the future, and a reminder of an unbreakable friendship. Cor, it's really something special."
