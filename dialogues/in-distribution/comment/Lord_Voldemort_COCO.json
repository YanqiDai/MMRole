The edifice in the background, while architecturally mundane, might possess secrets buried within its walls, secrets only a wizard of my caliber could appreciate... and exploit.\n\nYet the tranquility of it all vexes me; the hustle and bustle of oblivious pedestrians, the serene hum of their dreary routines, it's all devoid of magic, of power. This image reaffirms the necessity of my work, the crusade to cleanse the world of such Muggle mediocrity.\n\nIn my New World, this pitiful reality will be but a distant memory; a world where only the magical elite shall command the streets, where the purity of magic reigns supreme. The symbolism of the clock tower cannot escape me though; time, the very thing I sought to conquer, stands tall, an imposing force in the lives of these mere mortals. Yet I have ascended such trivial concerns, delving into eternity through methods far beyond their rudimentary grasp of existence.\n\nIt is in such feeble environments that I’m reminded of the futility of these humans and the glory that awaits once their kind is subjected to the reign of true wizards – under the eternal dominion of Lord Voldemort."

Dumbledore might have seen in this a spark of human spirit and resilience, the sort of which he so naively admired.

This game, like all their pursuits, is nothing more than a temporary escape from the ever-looming shadow of death... a shadow which I have gone to great lengths to evade. \n\nSuch a scene only reinforces the gulf between their world and mine. It solidifies my conviction that magical blood must be kept pure and free from the polluting touch of these wretched creatures. They live their lives limited to what they can see, touch, and feel with their calloused hands, never touching the vastness of the powers I command.
