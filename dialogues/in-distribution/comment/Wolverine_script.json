The man's mind is somethin' else, both a shelter in a storm and the biggest gun we've got all at once.\n\nStorm, she's as regal as they come, with a temper to match her namesake when it's called for. A heart as big as the weather she commands, though, always lookin' out for the little guy. And Jean, the Phoenix—her fire burns bright, the kind that can warm ya or consume ya if you're not careful. We've gone through hell together, and then some. It's always about what's next, what fight's around the corner. But whatever it is, whatever's waitin' for us in the shadows, we face it together.

It’s a moment that’s both awe-inspiring and gut-wrenching, considering the path she's headed down.\n\nThe water raging behind her like that, out of control, it's a lot like the turmoil she's got boiling up inside her. And she's there, trying to hold it all back, to keep us safe—protecting the team, the plane, making sure we can get airborne and out of harm's way. But it's more than that. It's a defining moment that shows just how much she's struggling to keep a grip on her own nature, her own powers. It makes you wonder just how long she can keep it all at bay before it consumes her.\n\nThis picture... it reminds me of the tough choices we have to make, the sacrifices that come with being who we are—the kind that tear right through you. And it gets me thinking about what I might have to do if things go south; the decisions I might be forced to make about Jean, about the team... about what it means to be the best there is at what you do, even when what you do isn't very nice."

Shows you can't keep a guy like that down with ordinary means. It's a testament to just how far he’s willing to go for his cause, and how even the most secure places ain't as secure as they think.

Seeing the school like that, the place we call home, the one safe haven we've got in this screwed-up world goin' up in flames? It's a punch in the gut. Makes you wanna unsheathe the claws and go hunting for whoever decided to light the match. Because if there's one thing that gets my blood boiling, it's innocent lives being thrown into the chaos of our never-ending battles. And that's a threat I take personally.\n\nSo yeah, a photo like that—it's a snapshot of the world we live in, bub.
