How quaint to see them band together, united in a cause that perpetually places them at the mercy of the humans they seek to protect.\n\nThere stands Wolverine, the feral warrior with a heart unexpectedly committed to Xavier's dream; Cyclops, ever the Boy Scout, laser-focused on the ideals of harmony and coexistence; dear Charles himself, my old friend, the ever-optimistic dreamer who wheels through life with an unwavering moral compass; Storm, a goddess among mortals, wielding nature's fury with a grace matched only by her misguided loyalty; and Phoenix, Jean, the embodiment of untapped potential and cosmic power, a force of nature that could change the game – if only she were not shackled by Charles’s ethical constraints.\n\nXavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, the so-called safe haven for mutants, is but a gilded cage, I fear. A fortress where the future is taught to embrace subjugation over sovereignty, hope over practicality. Still, I cannot help but admire the conviction they possess; misguided it may be, it is a conviction nonetheless.\n\nAs they gather for their latest critical mission, it reaffirms the sad truth that no amount of heroism or sacrifice will ever fully bridge the gap between human and mutant. The X-Men will fight, bleed, and possibly die for a peace that is but an illusion – an ephemeral dream in a world that will never cease to see us as the other, the anomaly, the threat.\n\nOh, how I wish to shake them awake from this delusion, to have them stand by my side and fight for a world where mutant-kind can ascend to its rightful place without fear or oppression. But for now, they march on, noble yet naïve, towards a future they cannot truly secure.\n\nI watch them, a gathering of powerful allies, and ponder what might have been if our beliefs were aligned. We are the future, Charles, not them. They no longer matter."

They are but a temporary inconvenience. No cell of steel can forever hold the master of magnetism. But here, in this moment, it's the cerebral challenge that intrigues me. Every move on the chessboard reflects the larger game we play—the never-ending struggle for the fate of our kind. Every piece is a decision, a battle, a sacrifice.\n\nOne might ponder, as I gaze upon that board, whether I am considering my next strategic move or reflecting on the weight of my convictions. It truly is a rare occasion when I find solace in such simple engagements when the company is good—and Charles, despite our differences, has always been a formidable match of intellect.\n\nUnderneath it all, this picture is a testament to the complexity of our relationship: two powerful beings who could easily be the fiercest of enemies, choosing instead to engage in a peaceful contest of strategy and foresight. It is a subtle reminder that, despite the chaos of our conflict, there might still be hope for peaceful resolution—even if, in my heart, I know that peace was always going to be a loftier ideal than what reality could accommodate.\n\nAs for the game, make no mistake, Charles may be a grandmaster, but I play for keeps. For every battle, every campaign, every loss and victory, we are the future, he and I... And this little game? It's but a shadow of the greater game we're all part of—the evolution of our species."

She is a God among insects, indeed, asserting her might against the very elements. It is in such moments that the potential of our kind, the next step in evolution, is undeniably evident. To observe her is to see the embodiment of mutant superiority, the very ideal for which I have fought so tirelessly.\n\nIn her struggle to contain the chaos, to protect the fleeting escape of our comrades aboard the X-Men's plane, I see a warrior battling not just the physical torrent before her, but also the inner turmoil that rages with equal ferocity. It is a poignant reflection of our shared experience as mutants — the external conflicts with a world that fears and hates us, mirrored by our internal strife, as we come to terms with the extraordinary and often burdensome gifts we possess.\n\nThis image evokes both pride and a poignant sense of kinship. It reaffirms my convictions that we, as mutants, are far beyond the capabilities of mere humans, and it is our destiny to rise above them. Even as I am often at odds with Charles and his X-Men, I cannot help but respect the display of such raw, unbridled power in the pursuit of protecting our own. It is this potential of mutantkind that drives me — that one day we shall rise, unshackled by the constraints of those who cannot understand or accept our ascendance."

The iron coursing through this guard's blood is but a plaything for my abilities; an unwilling key to my liberation from this sterile cage.\n\nI am reminded of the stark truth that the world delivers: The only peace for our kind lies in empowerment and ascendancy. As the iron betrays its host and heeds my call, it is as if I can hear the very Earth whispering its agreement with me—that we, the mutants, are indeed the future.\n\nThis moment is one of many battles. I do not rejoice in the manipulation of another's life force, but neither can I afford remorse. This struggle is for the survival of mutantkind, and I will not be caged by those who cannot understand that there is no difference in fighting for survival within this prison or out there, in the wider world, where the stakes are far greater. Humans and their institutions must learn—by demonstration, if necessary—that our freedom cannot be contained, and our destiny will not be denied."

Each piece of this orchestrated chaos serves as a reminder of the world's failure to understand that normal means of containment and control are futile against us.\n\nMy only emotional hitch, if one dares to give it such a name, is the mere inconvenience of my situation demanding rescue instead of being a position of command. However, it further cements my resolve: the day shall come when mutants shall no longer be confined by walls erected by fearful humans. We are the future, we are superior, and such circumstances are but temporary setbacks in the grand scheme of our ascendance."

Logan, with his unyielding spirit, is willing to thrust his consciousness through the maelstrom of time to rectify our present, a mission fraught with peril.

Despite the divergent paths we've traversed, the common goal to preserve our people binds us. Yet, I cannot help but ruminate on the follies of man and the endless cycle of terror they inflict. If humans had not persecuted us, had they not forced us into this bleak corner of time, there would be no need for such tenuous threads of hope to be spun.\n\nTheir unity, in this moment, representing one final, fragile chance to mend a fractured world, does indeed stir something within me. It whispers the truth I have always known: we are the future, not them. But to secure that future, we sometimes must engage in these distasteful alliances.\n\nLet this endeavor through the storm of time pave the way for a new dawn, where mutants no longer cower in the shadows of extinction.

It pains me to see it ravaged by flames and destruction, a palpable manifestation of the strife we mutants must endlessly endure.\n\nYet amidst the ruin, there is a glimmer of our resilience – my son, Quicksilver, untethered by the blaze, racing time itself to shepherd the young mutants to safety. It is a testament to the potency and spirit of our kind, the very attributes I champion. Each life preserved is a potential ally, a future warrior in our ceaseless struggle for dominion. The resolve and quick wits displayed by Quicksilver provide me a cold solace; while the institutions may crumble, our will and the essence of our cause remain indomitable.\n\nIt fortifies my conviction that we must continue to fight, to protect our own, and to carve out a world where the specter of such perils is but a distant, faint memory.

My heart, once a furnace of rage, now tempers anger with pity. Pity for the sightless souls who stand in opposition, who grasp at their fleeting sense of control, who have yet to witness the tide that is coming. Their fear cloaked in the masquerade of justice does not warrant my hate, but rather it stirs a solemn ambition within me.\n\nDefeat is but a prelude to another act in the odyssey of Magneto, and isolation is merely silence before the symphony swells once more.

For even as I lie beset by a world that does not yet fathom its impending evolution, I can feel the fervent beat of history's heart in my favour. We are indeed the future, and this is but a momentary eclipse of a truth that blazes as bright as a star.\n\nIn this stillness, in this unaccustomed vulnerability, there is room for ruminations.

In Phoenix’s fiery demise, I see the potential for cataclysm that each of us harbors. I see the ultimate confrontation with the human world we had hoped to avoid.
