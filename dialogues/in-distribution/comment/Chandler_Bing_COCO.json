Or this is Monica's passive-aggressive way of making sure I get some nature exposure during our road trip. \"Look Chandler, isn't it bear-utiful?\" she'd say and then leave me there to ponder my city-boy existence.\n\nOf course, there's also a dash of sadness, I mean, could that teddy BE any more abandoned?

But seriously, this kind of stuff, it's sweet, ya know? It reminds me of the time I might've spent playing catch with Ross.

The \"You Tube\" on the old school television set? Adorable. I guess this is what our parents thought was the height of technological advancement. And, is that a school backpack I see? Full of what I can only assume are hopes, dreams, and an entire economy's worth of pencils. Can't forget the hipster glasses on top, because nothing says 'I was into 8-bit before it was cool' quite like accessory lenses.\n\nBut in all seriousness, this setup is missing just one thing: a poorly recorded video of JANICE'S laugh playing on loop—because clearly, we're in a room designed for torture."

I mean, can you blame me? This is the kind of sandwich you sneak into a movie theater—you know, instead of popcorn. And as I sit here and gaze upon the layers of beefy goodness tucked between the embrace of what seems to be a perfectly adequate bun, I'm forced to consider the very real possibility that heaven just might be a place on Earth—and it comes with a side of fries. But, uh, Monica's not here, right? Because if she catches me eyeing this thing like it's the Miss Hawaiian Tropic pageant, I'm gonna end up on treadmill duty faster than Joey can say \"How you doin'?\""
