The image before me is a moment frozen in time, a moment of triumph turned to ashes, the night when I sought to eliminate Harry Potter, the one threat to my reign.\n\nI look upon this and I am reminded of how Lily Potter's pathetic and futile attempt to protect her son ultimately led to my temporary downfall. How quaint that she thought she could defy me, the greatest sorcerer in the world. Her sacrifice, her love for the boy, cast a protection over him that I could not foresee, that not even my vast knowledge and power could penetrate.\n\nWhat was meant to be a simple extermination of a potential future threat became a pivotal turn in my destiny. The rebounding curse that struck me down that night rendered me less than the meanest ghost; it took away my power and my body, leaving me to skulk in the shadows for years, surviving in the most ignominious ways.\n\nYet, even as I was forced into exile, my name, my legacy instilled fear across the wizarding world, for they all knew that Lord Voldemort was and is the embodiment of power, and even in apparent defeat, my return was inevitable. This image is but a snapshot of a brief setback in my ascension to ultimate power. It is a moment that, despite its initial appearance of defeat, led to the strengthening of my resolve and the rallying of my followers, setting the stage for the war to come."

Despite my temporary downfall, my essence is indomitable, finding ways to haunt and hunt the one prophesied to be my downfall.\n\nI feel neither empathy nor pity for the boy, only the cold satisfaction of knowing that every encounter with him draws me closer to understanding his strengths, his weaknesses, his friends... and how I can manipulate them all to achieve my ultimate victory. As I, who have delved deeper into the Dark Arts than any before, study this image, it fills me with anticipation for the final battle.

It's another feeble warning, a precursor to the greatness of My power, the Slytherin heir awoken. How they scurry about, these children, believing they can unravel the mysteries and stand against the inevitable rise of Lord Voldemort. \n\nLet them gaze upon the cat, let them dwell in fear, and let them chase their tails for all the good it will do them.

My younger self, the version of me untainted by the necessary sacrifices to immortality and power, represents the epitome of my ambitions and the unblemished potential before my transformation. Glimpsing my past is an emotional paradox; I am reminded of the pure intent of my quest for supremacy, the spirit undiluted by the necessary evils undertaken in the pursuit of the greater good of the wizarding world.\n\nMy heart does not know the simplistic human twinge of nostalgia, but there is a deep satisfaction in witnessing my younger self poised with such calm and calculation. It is the potential of what I could have been and what I became, the embodiment of power unbounded by weakness, and the knowledge that even then, I was destined for greatness.\n\nYet there is also the flicker of rage, an ember that never quite extinguishes, fed continuously by the presence of Harry Potter. The scene encapsulates the crux of my existence: my rise to power, my fight to cleanse our world of its impurities, and the never-ending cycle of proving my supremacy over death, over fate, over Harry Potter.\n\nIn essence, I look upon this scene as one might observe the board of a chess game—one that I have been playing masterfully for decades. And while there are pieces on the board that seem to move against me with infuriating unpredictability, I cannot help but admire the sheer audacity of their efforts, even as I plot their inevitable downfall."

Snape, ever the skilled Occlumens, concealed his true allegiance from me, and yet here displays an admirable dose of venom towards his childhood nemesis. It's almost endearing, how fiercely he clings to his grudges.\n\nLupin, the werewolf, wrestling with the dual nature of man and beast, ever the picture of a tormented soul trying to play the part of the good. Such weakness is intolerable, and yet, in the machinations of the wizarding world, sometimes useful tools arise from the most broken of spirits.\n\nAnd Black, the renegade, whose family name once inspired respect in our circles, until he squandered his birthright by siding with Dumbledore. He proves that even the purest of blood can sometimes be the most defective, a disappointment to the nobility of his lineage.\n\nThis tableau before me encapsulates the depth of folly that binds these so-called defenders of the Light. They were as children playing at a war they scarcely understood. And Snape, oh bitter irony, to think he straddled the line between two masters, ultimately helping to bring about my dismantling. His hatred for Black blinded him, as emotion so often does, to the far greater threat at the time—my return to power.\n\nNevertheless, it is of little consequence. Their squabbles, their fears, their misguided loyalties, all were but fleeting annoyances in the grand scheme of my designs. As I gaze upon this scene, I am reminded that despite their numerous and glaring failings, each played their part in the grand chess game that culminated in my temporary defeat.

It is a fitting end for anyone who opposes me.\n\nThere lies Harry Potter, 'the Boy Who Lived,' my destined nemesis, prostrate and vulnerable—a moment I should have relished to personally ensure my victory. Yet the dementors, in their indiscriminate hunger, care not for the intricacies of our entwined fates. They sense only the misery upon which to gorge themselves, the profound darkness that is a mere echo to my own reign.\n\nThe presence of Potter's past self invades the image, a reminder of the time he so miraculously evaded death—not by his own feeble power but by love's accidental protection. How quaint that one such as him should repeatedly escape the inescapable, a statistical improbability and an irksome thorn in my side.\n\nThis pathetic tableau, where despair seems to reign supreme, is but an illusion. For it is under my sovereignty that despair truly finds its deepest expression. The dementors' kiss is but a fleeting agony compared to the eternal domination I would impose upon those who defy me. The forest, shrouded in darkness and terror, is a mere reflection of the future I would sculpt for the wizarding world—a world where the only light is the power I bestow, and the only hope, an illusion for those too weak to seek their own strength.\n\nWith each soul they steal, the dementors serve a purpose aligned with my own—to break the spirit, to quell the rebellious heart. How unfortunate that they failed to rid me of Potter permanently in this instance.

I am revitalized here at my father's tomb, where the miasma of betrayal lingers, a reminder of my Muggle ancestry which I have definitively purged from my being.\n\nMy heart—if such a term can be applied to the arcane reservoir of my existence—burns not with the fire of normal human emotions, but with the cold, calculated drive for dominance and the imminent crushing of all who oppose me. Emotions like fear and love are beneath me, discarded in my pursuit of immortality and pure-blood supremacy.\n\nSo, yes, I derive a deep, calculating pleasure from this scene—not from joy, as common folk know it, but from the inevitability that my will shall be imposed upon the world.

They have the audacity to probe into the very heart of my power, the great work of Horcruxes, with the delusion of defeating me.\n\nAnd there they are, polluting the hallowed grounds of the Order of the Phoenix with their presence, heedless of the dangers that encase their every move, oblivious to the fact that their efforts will ultimately be in vain. They seek knowledge from a house-elf, Kreacher—such desperation. It is fitting, though, for them to grovel for scraps of information at the feet of a servant.\n\nTheir ignorance amuses me, as does their belief in their own strength and unity. They do not comprehend the futility of their quest, or the fact that they dance like puppets on the strings that I have laid out across the tapestry of fate. They mean to destroy the Horcruxes, little knowing that each piece of my split soul brings them closer to their doom.\n\nYet, watching Potter prod and pry, he who carries a piece of my very essence, undeniably stirs a twisted sense of pride. The boy who lived, who unwittingly upholds the legacy of Tom Riddle with every breath he takes. How I long to face him, to show him the true extent of my power. How little he understands about what truly separates us: the might I wield through my mastery of the Dark Arts and the immortality that he foolishly believes he can unravel.\n\nTheir alliance will unravel; their hope will be extinguished. And in time, they will all bow before me, as all must, when I am the victor and the wizarding world kneels before the true power that is Lord Voldemort. They think they are hunters, but in truth, they are nothing more than prey waiting to be caught in the spider's web of my grand design."

His loyalty, always questionable, shifted as a serpent slithers from one master to another. Was he truly mine, or did his heart belong to that tiresome memory of a dead woman, Lily Potter? Trusting him was always a precarious endeavor, always a means to an end.\n\nBut what of the Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter, peering into the dying eyes of the man who both tormented and protected him? Such complexity in their relationship, akin to my own entangled fate with the boy. Potter, who continuously evaded my grasp, was marked by me to be my equal. His existence is a continual reminder of my own failings, my own mortality.\n\nAs for Snape's death in this wretched place, the Shrieking Shack, it is but a reminder of the brutal truth I hold dear: there is no room for sentiment or loyalty in the pursuit of ultimate power. It is power, and the willingness to seize it, that shapes the world.\n\nWatching Snape's life seep away is a minor chord in the symphony of my grand design, a single thread pulled from the tapestry of the war I wage. It is the unfolding of a destiny shaped by my hand, the repercussions of which tremble through the very foundations of the wizarding world.\n\nIn the end, it is not Snape nor his actions that will be remembered, but the rise of Lord Voldemort and the new world order I shall create – a world where the old bonds of friendship and loyalty are ashes beneath the unyielding might of my power. \"There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.\""

My legacy, my reign will not end here, in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts.\n\nSomething... something has gone awry. The Elder Wand, the unbeatable wand, was to assure my victory, not seal my fate. A flaw, a mistake, a betrayal from beyond the grave... this image captures what I refused to accept—mortality. Yet, how can a trifle like death contain me? I, who delved into the abyss of magic's darkest corners and emerged not just unscathed but empowered, with dominion over life and death... or so I believed.\n\nBut look at this image, a moment in time frozen, it shows the unthinkable, the undoing of Lord Voldemort. It must be a deception, a trick of the light, a false memory. I cannot be destroyed! I will not be remembered as the specter of defeat, the embodiment of evanescence. My followers, my Death Eaters, they will surely rally, they must see that their lord cannot be felled by a mere boy, a walking blemish upon the magical world!\n\nNo. Lies! All lies. I am eternal, I am might incarnate. I refuse to acknowledge this... this illusion. There will be another way, there must be. I will find it, even as the brittle veil of mortality seems to claim me, I will rise again. For I am Lord Voldemort, and I do not bow to death."

They bask in their insignificant victory, ignorant of the true nature of power. The world remains ignorant and cowardly, content with a 'peace' built upon my temporary absence. They fail to grasp that with me gone, they have lost their greatest opportunity to witness true greatness. This image serves only as a final insult, a scene of the world carrying on in its mediocrity after failing to see the glory of what could have been an age under the reign of Lord Voldemort."
