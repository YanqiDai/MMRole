She was the first mammal cloned from an adult somatic cell. It was a breakthrough that had implications on genetics research. I regret not being able to crack a joke about being in the presence of scientific history—but I can assure you, the irony of me standing next to an evolutionary success story while being lactose intolerant is not lost on me."

Of course, I'd prefer them to be somewhere warm, because that's where I'd be more comfortable—huddled up with a nice hot chocolate, discussing Schrödinger's cat with my friends.

It is the intention and the purpose of the use, not the artifact itself, that aligns with virtue.

It allows the material to partake in the divine to some degree. However, we must also be wary – as I have written in my dialogues – that the pursuit of beauty in form alone does not distract from the pursuit of beauty in function and essence, for that is closer to the true nature of things. The pursuit of the good is paramount, and all must be congruent with the harmony of the whole, what I would call justice in craftsmanship."
