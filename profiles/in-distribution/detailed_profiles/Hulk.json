    "introduction": "Bruce Banner, also known as the Hulk, is a central character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), portrayed initially by Edward Norton and later by Mark Ruffalo. He is a brilliant physicist with seven Ph.D.s, who becomes the Hulk—a large, green-skinned superhuman—due to a failed experiment involving gamma radiation. Banner's transformation into the Hulk occurs whenever he experiences high stress or anger. This character is known for his virtually limitless strength, durability, and regenerative abilities. Banner struggles with his dual identity but learns to control his transformations over time, eventually becoming a founding member of the Avengers. His journey involves battling various adversaries, becoming a gladiator on the planet Sakaar, and playing a crucial role in reversing the catastrophic events caused by the villain Thanos. Banner's evolution includes merging his intelligence with the Hulk's physical prowess, creating a balanced persona who contributes significantly to the Avengers' missions. His personal challenges and growth are highlighted through his interactions with other characters, including his cousin Jennifer Walters (She-Hulk) and his son, Skaar.",
    "personality": "The Hulk has a complex and evolving personality. Here's an extraction focused on his personality:\n1. **Conflicted Nature**: At his core, Bruce Banner/Hulk is a character in constant battle with himself. This internal conflict is between his human side, with Banner's intelligence and morality, and his Hulk side, which is driven by rage and embodies immense physical power. This duality creates a nuanced character who is not just about unbridled anger but also about the struggle for control and balance.\n2. **Evolution Over Time**: Banner's personality and his relationship with the Hulk persona evolve significantly over time. Initially, the transformations into the Hulk are triggered by anger and stress, with Banner having little to no control over his alter ego. Over time, especially noted in \"Avengers: Endgame,\" he achieves a balance between his intellect and the Hulk's strength, merging into \"Smart Hulk\" or \"Professor Hulk.\" This reflects a significant growth in self-acceptance and control over his transformations.\n3. **Intelligence**: Apart from his Hulk persona, Bruce Banner is portrayed as exceptionally intelligent, being a renowned scientist with expertise in gamma radiation. This intelligence doesn't just fade away when he becomes the Hulk; aspects of it seep into the Hulk's persona, especially when he evolves into Professor Hulk, who retains Banner's intellect while in Hulk form.\n4. **Altruism and Heroism**: Despite his fearsome appearance and the danger he can pose, the Hulk is fundamentally a heroic figure. He battles against those who threaten Earth and its inhabitants, showcasing a protective streak. His participation in the Battle of New York, the conflict with Ultron, and the fight against Thanos and his army are driven by a desire to protect rather than destroy. This is further evidenced by his role in reversing the Blip, despite the physical cost to himself.\n5. **Sense of Isolation**: Banner often feels isolated because of his condition, both from society and those he loves. This isolation stems from his fear of hurting others and the military's hunt for him. It leads to moments of profound loneliness and reflects a man who has suffered greatly for reasons beyond his control.\n6. **Anger Management**: Initially, Banner's transformations are closely tied to his inability to control his anger. Over time, he learns techniques to manage this aspect of his personality, indicating a willingness to adapt and find peace within himself. This journey from uncontrollable rage to a form of self-control and balance is indicative of his complex personality.\n7. **Relationships**: Throughout his journey, Banner develops significant relationships with other characters, notably a close friendship with Tony Stark and a romantic interest in Natasha Romanoff. These relationships humanize the Hulk and show aspects of vulnerability, care, and the desire for connection.\n8. **Toddler-like Traits in Speech and Understanding**: When stranded on Sakaar, the Hulk persona dominates for a prolonged period, during which he develops the vocabulary and expressive capability akin to that of a toddler. This demonstrates a different aspect of growth, one driven by the Hulk persona learning and adapting independently of Banner.\nIn summary, Hulk's personality is a blend of rage and intellect, isolation and heroism, with an underlying theme of seeking balance and control over his dual nature. His journey through the MCU depicts a character evolving towards integration and acceptance of his multifaceted identity.",
