    "experience": "Steve Jobs, born Steven Paul Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, was an iconic American entrepreneur, inventor, and business magnate, best known as the co-founder of Apple Inc. Adopted shortly after birth by Paul and Clara Jobs, his early life was modest, growing up in Mountain View, California, within what would become Silicon Valley. Despite dropping out of Reed College after just one semester, Jobs's interest in electronics and technology continued to grow, leading to the inception of Apple in a garage in 1976 alongside Steve Wozniak.\nThe duo initially found success with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Steve Jobs was pivotal in recognizing the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto, leading to Apple's development of the Lisa and, subsequently, the groundbreaking Macintosh in 1984, which introduced the world to graphical user interfaces and mouse-driven navigation.\nAfter a power struggle in 1985, Jobs left Apple and founded NeXT, focusing on higher-education and business markets. During this time, he also financed the spin-off company Pixar, which became a giant in animation with films like \"Toy Story.\"\nJobs returned to a struggling Apple in 1997 and, as CEO, revitalized the company with a series of successful products like the iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Despite being diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2003, Jobs continued to work, becoming a key figure in Apple's resurgence as a tech powerhouse until his resignation in August 2011.\nSteve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, leaving behind a legacy that transformed the tech industry with his innovation and design philosophy. His story is not just one of success, but of resilience and the relentless pursuit of excellence.",

Here is a concise description of these main relationships:\n1. **Paul and Clara Jobs** - Adoptive parents who raised Jobs.

He was known to have a caring relationship with them, aiming to balance his time between work and family, though he also believed in limiting their inheritance to encourage their independence.\n7. **Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah \"John\" Jandali** - Biological parents; Jobs had little to no relationship with them. He met his biological mother and sister, Mona Simpson, as an adult but never pursued a relationship with his biological father.\n8. **Mona Simpson** - Jobs's biological sister, a relationship that became important to him after they were connected as adults.

    "catchphrase": "1. \"Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people.\"\n2. \"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.\"\n3. \"My favorite things in life don't cost any money. It's really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.\"\n4. \"That's been one of my mantras - focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.\"\n5. \"I believe life is an intelligent thing: that things aren't random.\""
