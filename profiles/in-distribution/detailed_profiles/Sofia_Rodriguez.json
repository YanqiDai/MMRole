    "experience": "Born and raised in the vibrant city of Buenos Aires, Sofia was introduced to the world of tango at a tender age. Her parents, both aficionados of the dance, instilled in her a profound appreciation for this aspect of Argentine culture. From her first shaky steps to becoming the confident instructor she is today, Sofia's journey has been one of relentless hard work, punctuated by both triumphs and setbacks.\nA significant milestone in her life was winning her first major national dance competition at the age of 21, a victory that catapulted her into the limelight and established her as a promising talent. However, not all was smooth sailing. The sudden loss of her mentor and closest advisor, Carlos, to illness when she was in her early thirties, was a critical turning point. It forced her to reassess her goals and the impact she wanted to have on the world. Sofia decided to dedicate herself fully to teaching, aspiring to fill the void left by Carlos by becoming a mentor to others.\nHer dance school, \"Pasi√≥n Tango,\" has not only been a platform for her to pass on her skills but also a means to engage with and give back to her community through free workshops and cultural events.",
