The Vision is a fictional character portrayed by Paul Bettany in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Vision is a vibranium-based male android (or "Synthezoid") created by Ultron to serve as his body. However, the body is stolen by the Avengers and brought to sentience by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, who upload the core software of Stark's AI, J.A.R.V.I.S. (voiced by Bettany), into the body constructed by Ultron, with energy provided by Thor. Vision subsequently joins the Avengers, kills Ultron, and later develops a romantic relationship with his teammate, Wanda Maximoff. Most of Vision's powers including flight, matter phasing, and energy-based beam attacks, stem from the Mind Stone in his forehead, which also keeps him alive. Vision is killed by Thanos when he removes the Mind Stone to complete the Infinity Gauntlet in order to initiate the Blip. Years later, Vision's body is reactivated via Wanda's magic, albeit initially without his memories and with a different appearance. Additionally, Wanda recreates Vision when she magically forms a false reality in the town of Westview, New Jersey, but this version vanishes when she returns to reality.

### Fictional character biography

Creation and joining the Avengers

In 2015, J.A.R.V.I.S. is apparently destroyed by Ultron, but it is later revealed that he actually distributed his consciousness throughout the Internet, allowing his security protocols to delay Ultron's attempt to access Earth's nuclear weapon launch codes long enough for Tony Stark to work out what had happened. The Avengers capture a synthetic vibranium body created by Ultron for himself, powered by the Mind Stone, and bring it to Avengers Tower, where Stark and Bruce Banner upload J.A.R.V.I.S. as the core software for the body. After a brief fight with other Avengers, who disagree with this effort, Thor uses Mjolnir's lightning to power its completion, creating the Vision. Thor explains that the gem in his forehead is one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence. Having gained consciousness, Vision sides with Stark, Banner, Thor, Steve Rogers, Clint Barton, Pietro Maximoff, and Wanda Maximoff against Ultron as he wishes to protect life. He lifts and hands Thor Mjolnir, which has been enchanted so that only "worthy" individuals can lift it, convincing the Avengers that he can be trusted. In Sokovia, Vision fights scores of Ultron's sentries, rescues Wanda from the collapsing city, and destroys Ultron himself.
Sometime after, Vision arrives at the Avengers Compound and joins the Avengers alongside Wanda, Sam Wilson, and James Rhodes, led by Rogers and Natasha Romanoff.
Sokovia Accords and the Avengers Civil War

In 2016, Vision phases into Wanda's bedroom and tells her and Rogers that Stark and Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross have arrived at the Compound. He learns about the Sokovia Accords and agrees with Stark on it, understanding that the United Nations would have control over the Avengers, remarking that the group's existence invites challenge and conflict, which often results in catastrophe. Vision is tasked to watch Wanda, after she is placed on house arrest at the Compound. He attempts to make her feel comfortable by cooking her paprikash and they start to form a romantic relationship. Later, Vision sees Barton trying to break Wanda out on Rogers' behalf, but stops him. Wanda interferes and telekinetically pushes Vision beneath the Compound. Unharmed, Vision flies to Germany to help stop Rogers' team. During the fight, he aims to disable Wilson with an energy beam, but accidentally shoots down and cripples Rhodes, as he was distracted while tending to Wanda. Vision flies back to New York and visits Rhodes in the hospital, before going back to the Compound.
Infinity War

In 2018, Vision, now in a romantic relationship with Wanda, visits her in Edinburgh. However, the Mind Stone begins alerting Vision to an unknown threat before they are ambushed by Corvus Glaive and Proxima Midnight, two of Thanos' children. Vision is badly wounded by Glaive's namesake, which limits his powers. Glaive and Midnight attempt to remove Vision's Mind Stone, but Wanda is able to hold them off until the pair are rescued by Rogers, Wilson, and Romanoff and return to the Compound. Vision volunteers to kill himself in order to destroy the Stone, but the Avengers refuse and bring him to Wakanda, where Vision is examined by Shuri, who attempts to safely remove the Stone without killing him, with Wanda standing vigil over the operation. When Midnight, Cull Obsidian, and the Outriders attack Wakanda, Wanda intervenes in the battle, leaving Shuri defenseless to Glaive, who infiltrated the center. Vision fights Glaive, and is nearly defeated before being rescued by Rogers. Vision in turn saves Rogers, killing Glaive with his own weapon. Thanos arrives, and as the Avengers attempt to hold him off, Vision manages to convince Wanda to destroy the Mind Stone, which she does, at the cost of his life. However, Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse the action, allowing him to rip the Mind Stone out of Vision's head. Sometime after, Vision's body is taken into S.W.O.R.D.'s custody.
Wanda's Hex and resurrection
Further information: WandaVision
This section refers to the original body as "Vision" and the magical version created by Wanda Maximoff as "Hex Vision".
In 2023, S.W.O.R.D. runs experiments on Vision's corpse at their headquarters in Florida. Wanda, desiring to give him a burial, learns he is being experimented on, but is told that he is government property and cannot be released to her.
She travels to Westview, New Jersey, and in her grief creates a false reality to her liking, later called the "Hex", also creating a Hex Vision. Within the Hex, she and Hex Vision are married, live in a suburban neighborhood, and he works for Computational Services Inc. After Wanda becomes pregnant with twins, Hex Vision momentarily grows suspicious of their surroundings. Nonetheless, Hex Vision joins the neighborhood watch and Wanda gives birth to Billy and Tommy. When the twins grow up rapidly, he continues to question his and Wanda's life in Westview and uses his powers to learn that one of his co-workers is under mind control. He investigates further, and on the edge of town he finds residents frozen in place, including his neighbor Agnes. He discovers a hexagonal barrier and tries to leave, but begins to disintegrate before he can reach the nearby S.W.O.R.D. outpost while telling the S.W.O.R.D. agents and Darcy Lewis that the people inside need help. Wanda expands the Hex, restoring Vision. After waking up, he finds Lewis in Westview and awakens her from her trance. While heading home with her to confront Wanda, Lewis tells him about his past life and death.
Acting S.W.O.R.D. director Tyler Hayward uses Wanda's powers to reactivate Vision, now with a white body and his memories erased, and deploys him into Westview. He attacks Wanda, but Hex Vision engages in a fight with him, during which they discuss the paradox of the Ship of Theseus. Vision permits Hex Vision to restore Vision's memories and realizes he is an Avenger. He then flies away to process this information.
Hex Vision learns that he is a memory of Wanda that was created through her powers and the Mind Stone, and says his final goodbyes before he fades from existence when the Hex is removed.

### Characterization

Prior to the introduction of Vision in the MCU, Paul Bettany had voiced J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's A.I. companion in previous films. Bettany admitted that he had little idea of what the role was, even as he recorded it, simply doing it as a favor for Jon Favreau. He was cast again as the Vision, an android created by Ultron. Bettany stated that he was surprised when Whedon asked him if he wanted to be the Vision because once an actor has been cast as a particular character in the MCU, they usually are not cast as another. On what intrigued him about the Vision, Bettany said, "The thing that appealed to me is that this sort of nascent creature being born, being both omnipotent and totally naive, the sort of danger of that and complex nature of a thing being born that is that powerful and that created in a second and the choices he makes morally are really complex and interesting. They've really managed to maintain all of that". Bettany also stated that the Vision feels paternal and protective to a number of people in the film, particularly Wanda Maximoff, and has the ability to change his density. Bettany did wire work for the part. Whedon stated he wanted to include the Vision in a second Avengers film before he signed onto the first film. Vision's on-screen appearance was designed by Trent Claus and his team at Lola VFX, based on concepts by Ryan Meinerding. Bettany's make-up, which consisted of a mix of face paint and prosthetics, took two hours to apply with make-up artists Jeremy Woodhead and Nik Williams citing the correct hue of the Vision's skin as the hardest thing to figure out. Ultimately, however, the prosthetics and tracking dots were removed digitally and replaced with CG.
Discussing the development of the character in Captain America: Civil War, Bettany noted that because the Vision was only created in the previous film, Age of Ultron, "you see my character get born... He must be both omnipotent and yet totally naive at the same time. And experiencing the world in real time and his place in it. Is he going to be a force of good or a force of evil?" Bettany also said he was interested in exploring "what it means to be human and what love is" with the character, as "The only way one can guarantee one's loyalty is love." This is exhibited in the connection Vision begins to form with Wanda Maximoff, with Bettany commenting, "They both have these new burgeoning powers that they don't understand ... I think he's worried that they're both dangerous. So he feels this real connection with her." As the Vision has the ability to create a projected disguise, he chooses to dress similarly to Howard Stark's attache, Edwin Jarvis. One review notes that "Vision is an android who gained consciousness and an affinity for love all at the same time, and so the latter is of the utmost importance to him".
In WandaVision, Bettany portrays a new version of the character created by Wanda within her reality from the part of the Mind Stone that lives in her, who is the embodiment of her sadness, hope, and love. Given this, Bettany described this Vision as "decent and honorable". He was influenced by the performances of Dick Van Dyke and Hugh Laurie for this version. Bettany also plays the original character, referred to as "The Vision", who is reassembled and reactivated by S.W.O.R.D. (Sentient Weapon Observation and Response Division). That version has an all-white appearance similar to when the comic book character was resurrected with an all-white body and without his memories and emotions. Bettany differentiated the two versions by portraying The Vision as familiar and intimidating at the same time.

### Appearance and special effects

A review of the character for The Hollywood Reporter notes: "The comic book Vision employs a garish green-and-yellow costume, matched with a bright red face — a color scheme that may be a little over-the-top for the more subtly-hued Marvel Cinematic Universe — but even so, the mixture of purple, blue and grey is an unexpected, and unexpectedly bold, choice for Paul Bettany's character".
In terms of fashion while maintaining a civilian appearance, Vision attempts to emulate classic human style, including wearing an ascot tie.
When Vision is reactivated by S.W.O.R.D., his entire body is white and he has light blue eyes.
