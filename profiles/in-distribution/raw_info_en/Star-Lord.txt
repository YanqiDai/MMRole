### Fictional character biography

Origin
Peter Quill was born in 1980 in St. Charles, Missouri. His father was the Celestial Ego (a fact of which Peter does not become aware until later in life), while his mother, Meredith, was a human from Missouri. As a child in 1988, Peter watches as his mother is dying from cancer. Unable to deal with it, he runs away and is abducted by the extraterrestrial spaceship of a mercenary gang called the Ravagers, led by Yondu Udonta. Although Yondu has been hired to deliver Peter to Ego, being aware of Ego's monstrous intentions, he instead keeps the boy and raises him as a surrogate son. Due to his own harsh upbringing, Yondu is stern with Peter, but also affectionate. At one point, he scoffs at a young Peter's attempt to celebrate Christmas, destroying his Christmas tree and throwing away his gifts, but later relents and opens the gift Peter gave him, gifting Peter a set of blasters in return.

26 years later, an adult Quill is a member of the Ravagers, and has had many adventures around the galaxy. While on a scavenging job, Quill finds himself embroiled in a significant power struggle and revenge war between two advanced galactic powers, the Kree warlord Ronan the Accuser and Xandar's Nova Corps, while also being hunted by Yondu after failing to bring him a stolen relic he found on Morag (later revealed to be an Infinity Stone).
After he successfully retrieves the Power Stone, he returns to Xandar, where he is confronted by Gamora, who attempts to steal the Stone for herself, and Rocket and Groot, who attempt to capture Quill to collect a bounty on him. After a fight breaks out, the four are sent to a Nova Corps prison called the Kyln. They break out with another cellmate named Drax the Destroyer and escape on Quill's spaceship, where they become the Guardians of the Galaxy. Gamora takes them to Knowhere, where the Collector explains the significance of the Infinity Stones. However, they are attacked by Ronan's forces and forced to flee, losing the Power Stone in the process. Learning that Ronan plans to use the Power Stone to completely destroy Xandar, they travel there to stop him, with the help of Yondu and the Ravagers. After a battle between Ronan's army and the Nova Corps, the Guardians manage to destroy Ronan's warship. Quill initiates a dance-off to distract Ronan while the others blast Ronan's axe to free the Power Stone, which they are able to use to disintegrate Ronan. In the end, Quill and the Guardians are hailed as heroes as he vows to keep an eye on the team in case they break any laws again. Throughout the film, Quill is shown listening to a mixtape of various hit songs from 1962 â€“ 1986 in a Walkman that was given to him by his mother, which serves as his only connection with Earth.

Quill, Gamora, and Drax go with Ego to his planet where they meet his ward Mantis. Ego informs Quill that he too possesses his Celestial abilities. Quill is initially happy to have found his father and to have family again, however, it is eventually revealed that Ego intends to terraform all other planets into extensions of himself, killing all other life, and had conceived Quill with the intention that his son would provide the extra power necessary to do so. After Ego reveals that he killed his mother, Quill turns against him. Quill keeps Ego occupied in combat with his newfound Celestial powers until Baby Groot places a bomb on Ego's brain. After Ego dies and Quill loses his Celestial powers, he is rescued from the planet's destruction by Yondu, who reveals himself as an adopted father to Quill.

Four years later, Quill and the Guardians respond to a distress signal and end up rescuing Thor, who is floating in space amidst the wreckage of the Statesman. Thor informs them that Thanos has begun his quest for the six Infinity Stones, with the Power Stone and Space Stone already in his possession. Quill takes Gamora, with whom he is now in a romantic relationship, to Knowhere, accompanied by Drax and Mantis. On the way, Gamora makes him promise to kill her if Thanos ever captures her, to prevent him from learning the Soul Stone's location which she only knows. On Knowhere, however, Gamora is captured by Thanos, but Quill fails to kill her as he had promised, because of Thanos' use of the Reality Stone as he leaves with Gamora. Quill, Drax, and Mantis travel to Titan and meet Tony Stark, Peter Parker, and Stephen Strange, in a brief confrontation in which they realize they are on the same side. They fight Thanos when he arrives and gain the upper hand, with Mantis subduing him with her powers, until Quill learns of Gamora's death from Nebula and grievously attacks Thanos, breaking Mantis' hold. Thanos is then able to obtain the Time Stone from Strange and depart Titan to finish assembling the Infinity Gauntlet. When Thanos snaps his fingers, Quill, along with Drax, Mantis, Parker, and Strange, fall victim to the Blip.
In 2023, Quill is restored to life and is brought through a portal to the destroyed Avengers Compound in upstate New York, where he participates in the final battle against an alternate version of Thanos. There, Quill meets an alternate Gamora, who being from another universe, rejects his affection. A week later, Quill attends Stark's funeral at his house. Quill then starts searching for where the alternate Gamora went and arrives in Norway to pick Thor up. As the team returns to space, they suggest that he should fight Thor for the honor of leadership, a suggestion that both he and Thor jokingly dismiss. Alongside Thor and Kraglin, the Guardians went on to answer various distress calls across the galaxy.

In 2024, Quill and the Guardians arrive in Indigarr to respond to a signal from a tribe of Indigarrians, which had been attacked by Habooksa the Horrible and his Booskan army. Severely outmatched, the Guardians enlist the help of Thor, who had been busy meditating. Quill cheers on Thor as the latter joins the fight, easily besting the Booskan army but destroying the Indigarrians's sacred temple in the process. The Guardians later set off to answer more distress calls as a result of Gorr's rampage across the galaxy, though Thor decided against joining them in order to assist his friend Sif, with Quill giving Thor words of advice before they part ways.
In 2025, Quill and the Guardians meet with the Collector and buy Knowhere from him, as well as gaining a new member of the team, Cosmo. However, Quill remains depressed about losing Gamora. At Christmastime, Mantis and Drax try to cheer him by kidnapping the actor, Kevin Bacon, and giving him to Quill as a gift. Quill makes them free Bacon, who then decides to stay and help the Guardians celebrate Christmas. Afterwards, Mantis reveals that she is Quill's half-sister, which brings Quill joy.

After rebuilding Knowhere, Quill has fallen into deep alcoholism, still saddened by Gamora's death. However, the Guardians are attacked by Adam, a superpowered being created out of revenge by his "mother" and the empress of the Sovereign, Ayesha. Rocket is seriously injured, leaving the Guardians unable to tend to his wounds due to a kill switch embedded in him. Quill and the team resolve to travel to the Orgoscope, headquarters of the High Evolutionary's company Orgocorp, in the hopes of finding an override code. With the assistance of the Ravagers and a reluctant alternate Gamora, they infiltrate Orgosphere and retrieve Rocket's file. However, they are attacked by Orgosphere's guards, barely escaping after Quill remotely activates the guards' suit jetpacks.
The team next visit Counter-Earth against Gamora's advice, who angrily bails out on them after calling out not only the Guardians as a whole for them constantly making up separate plans because they feel like it, but also Quill for his need to make her like the Gamora he once knew. Quill, Nebula, and Groot trace Orgocorp scientist Theel to the High Evolutionary's ship. The ship begins to launch with Quill and Groot captured onboard, and the pair successfully defeat the High Evolutionary's men and capture Theel, jumping off with him and retrieving his memory before Gamora meets them. On the Guardians' ship, Rocket flatlines, but Quill successfully implements the override code and revives him. As the Guardians subdue the High Evolutionary and rescue the children and animals being held on his ship, Quill barely escapes, beginning to freeze in space before being rescued by Adam.
After the battle, Quill bids farewell to Gamora, accepting that she is a different person than the one he fell in love with. He leaves the Guardians and bestows the rank of captain upon Rocket before leaving for Earth, where he reunites with his grandfather Jason.

### Characterization

Quill is introduced in Guardians of the Galaxy as the half-human, half-alien leader of the Guardians who was abducted from Missouri as a child in 1988 and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called the Ravagers. Pratt was cast in the role in February 2013, as part of a multi-film deal that he signed with Marvel. About the character, Pratt said, "He had a hard time as a kid, and now he goes around space, making out with hot alien girls and just being a rogue and a bit of a jerk, and through teaming up with these guys, finds a higher purpose for himself." He also added that the character is a mix of Han Solo and Marty McFly. Pratt, who was mostly known for playing supporting characters, including Andy Dwyer on the television series Parks and Recreation, initially turned down the role. Pratt had lost weight to portray fit characters in films such as Moneyball and Zero Dark Thirty, and had given up ambitions to play the lead role in action films after humbling auditions for Star Trek and Avatar. Casting director Sarah Finn suggested Pratt to Gunn, who dismissed the idea despite struggling to cast that role. Despite this, Finn arranged for a meeting between the two, at which point Gunn was immediately convinced that Pratt was perfect for the role. Pratt also won over Feige, despite having gained weight again for Delivery Man. Prior to filming, Pratt underwent a strict diet and training regimen to lose 60 pounds (27 kg) in six months. Pratt signed a multi-film contract with Marvel, and was granted a temporary leave from his work on Parks and Recreation to accommodate his participation in the film. Wyatt Oleff portrayed a young Quill in this film, and again in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.
In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Pratt said that Quill is now famous throughout "the galaxy for having saved so many people... He feels like he's part of this group, a leader of this group. He's a little more responsible and trying to stay out of trouble, but not necessarily doing the best job." Pratt stated that working on the film forced him to come to terms with the death of his own father. Pratt described his role in his next appearance, in Avengers: Infinity War, as a "guest star" appearance and said "you get to be a little more vibrant; a little more irreverent; a little bit more colorful if you want it to be".
Pratt said that Thor: Love and Thunder would continue the rivalry between Quill and Thor that was established in Infinity War and Endgame.
