Peter Parker is a fictional character portrayed by Tom Holland in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise–based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name—also known by his alias, Spider-Man. Parker is initially depicted as a student at the Midtown School of Science and Technology who received spider-like and superhuman abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Parker initially uses his powers to fight crime as a vigilante in Queens.
Parker is approached by Tony Stark, who mentors him and eventually recruits him into the Avengers during the conflict against Thanos. Following the Blip and Stark's death, Parker encounters Quentin Beck while on a school trip; Beck frames Parker for his murder and reveals his identity to the world, prompting Parker to seek Stephen Strange's help to reverse this. Strange's spell causes the multiverse to fracture, bringing in alternate versions of Spider-Man and their enemies. In order to repair the damage, Strange casts a spell that permanently erases the world's shared knowledge of Parker's civilian persona, including his relationships with his loved ones, friends, and other superhero allies.
Holland's version of the character is the successor to the Peter Parker portrayed by Tobey Maguire in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (2002–2007) and the Peter Parker portrayed by Andrew Garfield in Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man duology (2012–2014), both of whom reprise their roles and appear alongside Holland in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). Holland has received praise and several accolades for his portrayal of the character.

### Fictional character biography

Peter Parker's story in the MCU takes place in the Earth-616 universe.[a] The fictional biography below also includes events that happened to Parker from other universes.
Early life
Peter Parker was born on August 10, 2001, in Forest Hills, Queens, and is primarily raised by his Aunt May. When he was just a child, he attended a Stark Media Expo, where he was rescued by Iron Man. While attending high school at the Midtown School of Science and Technology in 2015, Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider, giving him superhuman abilities. He becomes the superhero Spider-Man by using his powers for good, and maintains a secret identity so his enemies can not attack his friends and family. At Midtown School, Parker is smart but is frequently bullied by Flash Thompson. He also befriends Ned Leeds, who has been his best friend since they were young. He constructs a homemade Spider-Man suit, designing it as a red and blue hoodie also equipped with his web-shooters.

In 2016, Parker is living with May in Queens, New York when he meets Tony Stark at his apartment, who reveals that he knows Parker is Spider-Man; Stark recruits him to join his conflict with Steve Rogers and sends Parker to Germany. There Parker is given a new Spider-Man suit designed by him and is brought to the Leipzig/Halle airport to aid Stark and his faction, consisting of James Rhodes, Natasha Romanoff, T'Challa, and Vision, against Rogers' team, consisting of Bucky Barnes, Sam Wilson, Clint Barton, Scott Lang, and Wanda Maximoff. Parker is a fan of Rogers despite them being on opposing sides, while Rogers likewise respects Parker's bravery. They briefly exchange where in New York they are from upon fighting. After incapacitating Barnes and Wilson, and helping to defeat a giant Lang, Parker is sent back to Queens.
Two months later, Parker continues to try to balance his life as a high school student and Spider-Man, but eagerly awaits his next mission from Stark and continuously texts Stark's driver and bodyguard Happy Hogan. After Parker returns home from operating as Spider-Man, Leeds accidentally learns Parker's secret identity. Parker and Leeds attend a school party hosted by his crush, senior student Liz, but leaves early to stop a drug deal by Jackson Brice and Herman Schultz, who planned to sell Chitauri weapons to Aaron Davis. Parker follows Brice and Schultz before being caught by their boss Adrian Toomes, who drops Parker to a nearby lake. Stark remotely saves Parker using one of his Iron Man armors, and warns Parker of further involvement with Toomes. On an academic decathlon trip to Washington, D.C., Parker and Leeds disable the tracker on Parker's suit, and Parker intercepts Toomes on a Damage Control truck in Maryland, but gets knocked out and trapped in a Damage Control storage vault. He misses the decathlon, but rescues his class at the Washington Monument after a Chitauri core explodes. Back in New York, Parker captures Toomes' new buyer Mac Gargan aboard the Staten Island Ferry, but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half, which Parker attempts to briefly fix it before Stark arrives and saves the passengers. Stark confiscates Parker's suit as punishment for his recklessness, and Liz accepts to be Parker's homecoming date.
Later, while on the way to pick Liz for the homecoming dance, Parker discovers Toomes is Liz's father and Toomes also deduces Parker is Spider-Man. Toomes gives Parker one final chance to not interfere with his business out of gratitude for Parker previously saving Liz's life, but Parker abandons Liz to stop Toomes from stealing a Damage Control cargo plane that is shipping equipment from Avengers Tower using his homemade suit. When Toomes' Vulture suit is damaged, Parker saves his life, but leaves him in a web for the DODC and Hogan to arrest. The next day at school, Liz is angry at Parker for abandoning her before tearfully informing him that she and her mother will be moving away since Toomes is imprisoned. Hogan brings Parker to Avengers Compound, where Stark congratulates him on defeating Toomes, admits he underestimated him and offers him a place in the Avengers, showcasing the newly-developed Iron Spider armor with it. Parker declines the offer, preferring to focus on local activities in Queens. When Stark returns the Spider-Man suit to him, Parker puts it on, at which point a shocked May learns he is Spider-Man.

In 2018, while headed on a field trip, Parker sees the Q-Ship above New York City and asks Leeds to cover for him as he leaves the school bus. As Spider-Man, he helps Stark fight Cull Obsidian and follows Ebony Maw—who had captured Stephen Strange–to his spaceship. This prompts Stark to fly into space and rescue Parker, sending the Iron Spider armor to Parker. He and Stark rescue Strange and kill Maw, and Stark officially declares Parker an Avenger. The spaceship lands on the planet Titan, where Parker, Stark, and Strange are confronted by some members of the Guardians of the Galaxy, before they realize that they are both on the same side: stopping Thanos. Thanos eventually arrives and Parker helps subdue him along with Stark, Strange, Peter Quill, Drax, and Mantis. However, Quill attacks Thanos, making Parker lose his grip on removing the Infinity Gauntlet. Parker rescues an unconscious Quill, Drax, Nebula, and Mantis after Thanos throws Titan's moon at them. Thanos leaves and is successful in disintegrating half of all life, including Parker, in the Blip.
In 2023, Parker is restored to life and is brought via a portal to the destroyed Avengers Compound to assist the Avengers and their allies in defeating an alternate 2014 Thanos. Parker reunites with Stark, who later sacrifices his life to save the universe; Parker attends his funeral and returns to high school, having a heartfelt reunion with Leeds.
European vacation and encountering Mysterio
Main article: Spider-Man: Far From Home
Eight months later in mid-2024, Parker still reeling from Stark's death decides to take a break from vigilantism and goes on a school trip to Europe with Leeds and other classmates, where he plans to reveal his romantic feelings towards his classmate Michelle Jones. In Venice, Parker and his classmates are attacked by a water monster but are saved by Quentin Beck. Parker is approached by Nick Fury, whose calls he had been fielding and who appoints Beck as his teammate in battling further element-based monsters (the "Elementals") throughout Europe. Fury gives Parker "E.D.I.T.H.", an artificial intelligence created by Stark to give to Parker. After defeating the Fire Elemental in Prague, Parker feels he "isn't ready to be the next Iron Man" and gives E.D.I.T.H. to Beck, who unbeknownst to Parker is a former disgruntled employee of Stark's.
Parker goes on a walk with Jones, and reveals his attraction to her and accidentally his identity as Spider-Man. The pair discover Beck used holographic projectors to visually create the Elementals, and Parker goes to Berlin to warn Fury about Beck's deception. Beck catches wind of this and traps Parker in multiple illusions, and while impersonating Fury, tricks the latter into telling the names of the students that know his fraudulence. Parker is hit by a train and left for dead in the Netherlands, but calls Hogan and creates a new suit for himself using Stark's technology as he enters London to stop Beck, who has created an amalgamated Elemental using Stark Industries drones. Leeds and Jones evacuate the students and fight with Hogan while Parker destroys those drones and approaches Beck. Beck attempts to kill Parker using the drones, but Parker manages to get a drone to shoot him, Beck beginning to bleed. Parker gets E.D.I.T.H. back, as Beck seemingly dies, and disables the drones. Parker and his classmates return to New York City, with he and Jones planning a date the following week.
Exposed secret identity, multiversal crisis, and losing Aunt May
Main article: Spider-Man: No Way Home
After swinging through the city, Parker and MJ witness a broadcast from J. Jonah Jameson of TheDailyBugle.net showing an edited video of Beck incriminating Parker for the London attack and revealing his identity as Spider-Man, much to the latter's shock. Parker, MJ, Ned, and May are interrogated by Damage Control. While the murder charges are dropped with lawyer Matt Murdock's help, Parker and his friends still grapple with negative publicity from Jameson and Beck supporters. Parker and May then move into Happy Hogan's apartment for their safety. After his, Ned, and MJ's applications to MIT are rejected in light of the controversy, Parker goes to the New York Sanctum to ask Stephen Strange for help. Strange, despite Wong's warnings, attempts to cast a spell that would make everyone forget Parker is Spider-Man, though Parker repeatedly tampers with it. He tries to convince an MIT administrator to reconsider his and his friends' applications before being attacked by Otto Octavius, who rips Parker's nanotechnology from his Iron Spider armor, which bonds with his mechanical tentacles and allows Parker to disable them. As the Green Goblin appears and attacks, Strange teleports Parker and Octavius to the Sanctum, where he explains that before he could contain the tampered spell, it summoned people from alternate universes who know Spider-Man's identity and which allowed the multiverse to be broken open. Strange orders Parker, MJ, and Ned to find and capture multiversal visitors; they locate and retrieve Max Dillon and Flint Marko, and later, Parker retrieves Norman Osborn from a F.E.A.S.T. building and discovers that the latter, Dillon, and Octavius were pulled from their universes just before their deaths.[b] He refuses to send the villains home to their deadly fates in their original realities and traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, stealing the spell, takes the villains to Hogan's apartment, and cures Octavius.
The Goblin persona, having taken control of Osborn, convinces the uncured villains to betray Parker, and a fight ensues which culminates with Goblin fatally wounding May before escaping. Before she dies, May tells Parker that "with great power, there must also come great responsibility". After May's death, a bereaved Parker, whose guilt was accentuated by Jameson's gaslighting reporting, is ready to give up and send the villains to die; he is comforted by his friends and meets two alternate versions of himself that are later nicknamed "Peter-Two" and "Peter-Three". The alternate Parkers share stories of losing loved ones and encourage Parker (later nicknamed "Peter-One") to fight in May's honor. They develop cures for the villains and lure the Lizard, Dillon, and Marko to the Statue of Liberty, managing to cure them. The Goblin appears and unleashes the contained spell, and an enraged Peter-One tries to kill him before being stopped by Peter-Two. The former and Peter-Three inject the Goblin cure into him, curing Osborn of his Goblin persona.
Peter-One realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase Peter Parker from everyone's memory and requests that Strange do so, while promising MJ and Ned that he will find them again. Heartbroken about having to forget each other, Peter and MJ reclaim their love for one another and share a passionate kiss as the spell is about to be cast. The spell is cast and everyone returns to their respective universes, with him saying goodbye to his alternate versions. A few weeks later, Parker visits MJ and Ned to reintroduce himself, but decides against it, not wanting to endanger them. While mourning at May's grave, he has a conversation with Hogan and is inspired to carry on, but decided to isolate himself from his allies and fellow superheroes in order to keep them safe, as he came to believe that he was dangerous to be around. Parker, having dropped out of school and moved into a new apartment, starts studying to get his GED and makes a new suit to resume his super-heroics as Spider-Man, who is now re-considered as a hero.

### Characterization

Parker is recruited by Stark in Civil War to help him arrest Rogers and his rogue Avengers. Feige said that Parker would be torn between superhero ideologies, saying, "Does he want to be like these other characters? Does he want nothing to do with these other characters? How does that impact his experience, being this grounded but super powerful hero? Those are all the things that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko played with in the first 10 years of his comics, and that now we can play with for the first time in a movie." On aligning with Stark, Anthony Russo said that, despite entering the conflict after the two factions have formed and not having much political investment, Parker's choice comes from "a very personal relationship" he develops with Stark. The Russos hoped "to take a very logical and realistic and naturalistic approach to the character" compared to the previous film portrayals. Anthony Russo added that the character's introduction had to fit "that specific tonal stylistic world" of the MCU, as well as the tone established by the directors in Winter Soldier, saying, "It's a little more grounded and a little more hard-core contemporary." That was "coloring our choices a lot" with Parker.
Though the MCU films do not depict Parker's origin story, Parker's Uncle Ben, whose death was a significant event in both the comic books and previous film series, is indirectly referenced; there was some discussion to include a direct reference to Ben in Spider-Man: Homecoming when Peter is getting ready for his homecoming by the revelation that his wardrobe consisted of Ben's clothes, but the writers desisted because they felt that the moment veered away from Parker's character arc and made Ben's death feel like a "throwaway line". The one exception is the animated What If...? episode "What If... Zombies?!", where an alternate version of Parker mentions everyone who has died in his life in the episode's timeline.
Another change is Parker's close paternal relationship with Stark. This was partially adapted from the limited series Civil War, its three-issue prelude on The Amazing Spider-Man by J. Michael Straczynski, and the Ultimate Marvel comics where Stark and Parker share a trainer-trainee relationship.[citation needed] Some critics disliked Parker's reliance on Stark, as opposed to previous cinematic portrayals of Spider-Man showing the character as more self-reliant; several of Parker's proper Spider-Man suits in the MCU are also designed by Stark, or built by Parker with Stark Industries technology, whereas in the comics Parker designed and constructed much of his suits entirely by himself while Stark only made the Iron Spider armor.
Parker's relationship with Gwen Stacy does not exist in the MCU, instead he falls in love with Michelle "MJ" Jones-Watson (Zendaya) a fellow school student after his previous crush, high school senior Liz, moves away. Although MJ is an original character, Spider-Man: Homecoming co-screenwriter John Francis Daley stated that she was intended as a reinvention of Mary Jane Watson and that the nickname was an homage to her.
