James "Jimmy" Howlett, also known as Logan or by his codename, Wolverine (named after the mammal/mustelid), is a fictional character originating as the primary protagonist of 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series, and appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise produced by Marvel Studios. He is portrayed by Hugh Jackman and based on the Marvel Comics character Wolverine, created by Roy Thomas, Len Wein and John Romita Sr.
Logan has been the central figure of the film series, having appeared in nine films since his introduction in X-Men (2000). The character and Jackman's performance have been credited with helping to cement the series as a multi-billion-dollar franchise, with Logan's appearance often being considered the face of the X-Men.

### Fictional character biography

Early life
Further information: X-Men Origins: Wolverine, X-Men: First Class, and The Wolverine (film)
James Howlett was born in Canada in 1832. His mutant powers are awakened when, at 13, he stabs his family's groundskeeper for killing his father. Discovering that the groundskeeper was in fact his biological father and seeing the revulsion in his mother's eyes over James killing him, James flees. With his half-brother Victor Creed, Howlett spends the next century fighting in numerous wars including the Second World War. While held in a Japanese POW camp in 1945, he saves the life of Japanese officer Ichirō Yashida from the bombing of Nagasaki. In 1962, Howlett is approached by Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr, who are recruiting mutants. Howlett instead tells Xavier and Lehnsherr to "Go fuck yoursel[ves]".
Original timeline
Team X and becoming the Wolverine
Further information: X-Men Origins: Wolverine
During the Vietnam War, he protects Victor for killing a superior officer who had tried to stop Victor from killing a village before being imprisoned when they survive their execution. After the war, he becomes a member of a black-ops strike team "Team X", led by Colonel William Stryker, before leaving due to the group's disregard for life. However, Howlett's past catches up to him in Canada where he is living under the name "Logan", despite his relationship with Kayla Silverfox, with both the Weapon X project in which he's pitted against Stryker and Creed in 1988, having adamantium grafted to his bones. Taking the name "Wolverine" after the Algonquian spirit, Kuekuatsheu, Howlett works together with Creed to fight and kill Weapon XI, after which Stryker shoots Howlett in the brain with adamantium bullets before being arrested. Though he survives, his memory is lost, with his only identifying personal effects being his dog tags.

Years later, in the early 2000s, Logan is an amateur cage fighter in Laughlin City, Alberta. There Logan meets Marie "Rogue" D'Ancanto, a mutant teenage girl who has run away from home. They are attacked on the road by Victor Creed, now known as Sabretooth and a minion of Magneto. Two of Xavier's students – Cyclops and Storm – arrive and save them. Logan and Rogue are brought to Xavier's mansion and school for mutants in Westchester County, New York. Xavier tells Logan that Magneto appears to have taken an interest in him and asks him to stay while Xavier's mutants, the X-Men, investigate. Rogue enrolls in the school, and visits Logan while he is having a nightmare. Startled, he accidentally stabs her, but she is able to absorb his healing ability to recover. Disturbed by this event, Rogue leaves the school, and Logan finds her on a train and convinces her to return. Before they can leave, Magneto arrives, knocks out Logan and subdues Rogue, revealing it was Rogue who he wants rather than Logan. Learning that Magneto plans to use a machine to "mutate" world leaders meeting at a summit on nearby Ellis Island, Logan and the other X-Men scale the Statue of Liberty, battling and overpowering the Brotherhood of Mutants, with Logan throwing Sabretooth off of the building into the ocean. After helping stop Magneto's plan, Logan is directed by Professor X to an abandoned military base around Alkali Lake that might contain information about his past, taking Cyclops' motorcycle.
Four days later, while stopping on his way to Alkali Lake to refill his gas tank, Logan notices that Sabretooth has been tracking him and attacks him, stopping after noticing him to have similar dog tags to his own, and that Sabretooth is not trying to kill him. Offering him a drink, the two drink in a nearby bar, with Sabretooth revealing his fall from the Statue of Liberty to have restored some of his own erased memories, of his name being "Victor", of killing babies and old men, and of Logan. They are interrupted by soldiers searching for Victor, who recognizes Logan as "Weapon X". Fighting the soldiers, Logan and Victor are surprised that they show instinctive teamwork side-by-side, but they are eventually brought down. The two wake up restrained on a helicopter, and after apologizing to Logan for their past, having remembered them to be brothers, Victor throws Logan out of it, sacrificing himself to save him. William Stryker then has adamantium bonded to Victor's bones, which fails as he had originally expected, although he is content with one new success story, Lady Deathstrike. Learning of Logan's survival, Stryker expects to see "Wolverine" again.
Three days later after that, Logan returns to Professor X's school for mutants where he encounters Stryker, to which he and the X-Men teams up with Magneto and Mystique to stop him. During a confrontation with Stryker and Lady Deathstrike, Logan regains some of his memory but opts to remain with the X-Men over Stryker's objections, while Stryker is killed when Alkali's base floods after sustaining damage.
A few years later, Xavier sends Logan and Storm to investigate the disappearance of Scott Summers at Alkali Lake, but they find only telekinetically floating rocks, Summers' glasses, and an unconscious Jean. Xavier explains to Logan that when Jean sacrificed herself to save them, she freed the "Phoenix", a dark and extremely powerful alternate personality which Xavier had telepathically repressed. Logan is disgusted to learn of this psychic tampering with Jean's mind. When she awakens, she starts seducing him aggressively, but he notes this behaviour as the Phoenix. Logan discovers that she killed Summers and is not the Jean Grey he once knew. Jean kills Xavier and joins Magneto, who plans to have mutants loyal to him storm a Worthington Labs facility housed in Alcatraz to destroy a supposed "cure" for mutants. Logan, Storm, and Beast lead the remaining X-Men in challenging the attack, and Logan has Colossus throw him at Magneto to distract him long enough for Hank McCoy to inject Magneto with the "cure" and thus nullify his powers. Army reinforcements arrive and shoot at Jean just as Logan had calmed her down. The Phoenix is awakened by the attack and disintegrates the troops, and begins to destroy Alcatraz and anyone within range of her powers. Logan realizes that only he can stop the Phoenix due to his healing factor and adamantium skeleton. When Logan approaches her, Jean momentarily gains control and begs him to save her, and everyone else, by killing her. Logan fatally stabs Jean, killing the Phoenix, but mourns her death.
Isolation
Further information: The Wolverine (film)
Years later, the guilt-ridden Logan lives in isolation in the Yukon. He is located by Yukio, a mutant with the ability to foresee people's deaths, sent by an elderly Ichirō Yashida wanting to repay Logan for being saved during World War II, but Logan refuses to have his healing powers transferred into Yashida. With Yukio as his side, this leads to a series of events where Wolverine protects Ichirō's granddaughter, Mariko Yashida from Ichirō's son, Shingen Yashida. In the course of these events, Logan's healing powers are damaged, his adamantium claws are severed, and he is finally able to let go of his guilt over Jean's death. After finally returning to the United States two years later, Logan finds himself approached by Magneto and a resurrected Professor X while learning of a new threat to all mutants. A deleted scene shows the titular character's yellow costume from the source material in a suitcase.
Going back in time
Further information: X-Men: Days of Future Past
By 2023, the world is controlled by Sentinels, where Wolverine has teamed up with surviving mutants and the X-Men. Logan's mind is transferred back in time into his 1973 self (during the events of the opening war montage of X-Men Origins: Wolverine) to help the younger Charles and Lehnsherr, as well as Hank McCoy, deter Mystique from assassinating Bolivar Trask, preventing the apocalyptic future from occurring. Once his mission is fulfilled, the original timeline is erased.
Revised timeline
Captured by Weapon X
Further information: X-Men: Apocalypse
In the revised timeline, although initially rescued by Mystique, the 1973 Logan is eventually captured by Stryker, given an adamantium skeleton and subjected to brutal mental conditioning, leaving him on a more feral stage than human. When some of the X-Men are captured by Stryker's men in 1983, Jean, Scott, and Nightcrawler infiltrate Stryker's base and find a cage with Jean sensing the human mind underneath and releasing him so that he can help. After he tears through Stryker's forces, the three mutants find him and Jean telepathically restores some of Logan's human memories before he runs off at a small side-exit into the snow.[a]
Modern day
Further information: X-Men: Days of Future Past
Over the next 40 years, Logan joined the X-Men, ultimately becoming a history teacher at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. In 2023, Logan's past self regains consciousness with no memory of his future self's activities wakes up in his new timeline's body to a changed future.
Alternate timeline
Fall of the X-Men
In a dystopian, seemingly alternative timeline that mixes elements of history from previous timelines, with no new mutants known to have been born in nearly 25 years, Logan's healing factor began to suffer severe deterioration, causing him to finally begin showing his age. In addition, due to this decreased state of healing, he is slowly dying from adamantium poisoning. By 2028, Xavier would develop Alzheimer's, and inadvertently kill several hundred people, including several of the X-Men, in a seizure-induced psychic attack in Westchester County. Logan asks the assistance of Caliban to help care for Xavier. He and Caliban would take Xavier to a place in Mexico near the U.S border, caring for him over the following year while attempting to raise money to purchase a Sunseeker yacht for the two of them to live in peace on.
Death
Further information: Logan (film)
In 2029, Logan spends his days working as a chauffeur under his birth name and hustling for prescription drugs along the border between the United States and Mexico. He and Caliban live in an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Mexico and care for the senile Xavier. He is tasked by Transigen's former nurse Gabriela Lopez to escort the 11-year-old Laura to a place in North Dakota called "Eden." Logan, Charles and Laura escape Transigen's hunters led by Donald Pierce and discover that Laura is Logan's daughter bred from his DNA. After accepting shelter from the Munson family they helped on the highway, Xavier is killed by a feral clone of Wolverine from which Logan and Laura escape and bury Xavier's body near a lake.
Eventually, Logan and Laura arrive at Eden, a safe haven run by Rictor and former Transigen test subjects. There, Logan learns that the children will make an eight-mile journey across the forest to the Canadian-American border and entrusts Laura to lead before departing on his own. But when the children are located and captured, Logan uses a mutant serum provided by Rictor to restore his strength and healing factor. He meets Zander Rice, killing the mutant virus' creator. Despite Rice and Pierce being killed, Logan is no match for his clone, who impales Logan through a tree with his healing factor now gone. Laura shoots the clone in the head with an adamantium bullet that Logan had kept with him for years. Logan tells Laura not to become the weapon that she was made to be, and after she tearfully acknowledges him as her father, he dies peacefully in her arms. Laura and the children bury him before continuing the journey across the border. Laura places the cross on his grave on its side to create an "X" to honor him as the last of the X-Men.

### Characterization

Personality
Relying on his senses and his instincts to get him around, Logan's personality comes in ranking as an ISTP according to the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator. His personage has been reviewed as a 'loner', often taking leave from the X-Men to deal with personal issues or problems. He is often irreverent and rebellious towards authority figures, although he is a reliable ally and capable leader, and has occasionally displayed a wry, sarcastic sense of humor. The character in the film had few lines, but much emotion to convey in them thus, Jackman watched Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies and Mel Gibson in Mad Max 2 as inspirations.
Appearance
The casting of Jackman was initially met with criticism upon its announcement, as he was considered too tall and good-looking to play the "short and somewhat feral Canadian". Jackman, at six feet three inches (1.9 m), stands one foot (30 cm) taller than Wolverine who is said in the original comic book to be five feet three inches (1.6 m). Hence, the filmmakers were frequently forced to shoot Jackman at unusual angles or only from the waist up to make him appear shorter than his actual stature, while his co-stars wore platform soles. Jackman was also required to add a great deal of muscle for the role, and in preparing for the films, he underwent a strict diet and exercise regimen. The scenes in the franchise in which Logan appears shirtless, in particular X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), have been widely noted by Jackman as the primary reason the character was established as a sex symbol. For the film, Jackman underwent a high-intensity weight training regimen to improve his physique for the role. He altered the program to shock his body into change and also performed cardiovascular workouts. Jackman noted that no digital touches were applied to his physique in a shot of him rising naked from the tank within which Logan has his bones infused with adamantium.
Speaking on why the classic comic book costume of Wolverine has never been worn onscreen, the director James Mangold believed the yellow costume has never made sense in any X-Men movie and seemed out of character, stating, 'Finding the rationale for a uniform when the character disdains self-promotion, why he would put on some outfit that promotes himself as some kind of hero? The flesh and blood character is very loyal to that iconoclastic rebel who doesn't seem to be the first to don spandex. [...] who puts a special branded outfit on when they do good deeds? And why? The only reason you do it is so you can have some sort of trademarked claim and get credit for what you did. Nothing seems less Wolverine-like than the desire to put on a trademarked outfit, particularly canary yellow, [...] Essentially, it's something that lives on the page and I'm not sure could live anywhere else.'
