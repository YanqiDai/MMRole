Thanos is a fictional character portrayed primarily by Josh Brolin in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics supervillain of the same name. He is depicted as an alien warlord from the doomed planet Titan with a universe-spanning agenda to wipe out half of all life to stabilize overpopulation and prevent what he views as life's inevitable extinction. To do this, he sets out to obtain the six Infinity Stones, cosmic gems with the power to achieve his goal. With the help of his adopted children, Thanos fights against the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and their allies, in the Infinity War, succeeds in assembling the Stones, and disintegrates half of all life in the universe in an event that is known as the Blip. After escaping to the Garden and destroying the Stones, he is eventually killed by Thor. Five years later, an alternate version of Thanos from 2014 time travels to 2023 to battle the Avengers once again, but is killed by Tony Stark.
Thanos is a key figure in the 23 films that make up the MCU's Infinity Saga, having appeared in five of its films, most notably Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). Several versions of Thanos from alternate realities in the MCU multiverse also appear in Endgame, the Disney+ animated series What If...? (2021â€“present), and the Phase Four film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022).
Thanos' appearance changed drastically over the course of his appearances as advances in CGI and motion capture technology allowed for better capture of Brolin's facial features. A new facial capture application called Masquerade was created for Infinity War and Endgame using machine learning. The character has been well received by critics and fans alike, with Brolin winning multiple awards for his performance. Thanos is often credited as one of the MCU's best villains, as well as one of the greatest film villains of all time. After his appearance in Infinity War, he became a key figure in popular culture and memes, making appearances in a variety of other media.

### Fictional character biography

Thanos' story in the MCU takes place in the Earth-616 universe.[b] The fictional biography below includes events that happened to Thanos from more than one Earth-616 timeline, as well as events that happened to him from multiple other universes.
Early life
Thanos was born approximately 1,000 years ago on the planet Titan to A'Lars, along with his brother Eros. Thanos deems the growth of Titan's population to be unsustainable, so he proposes to arbitrarily kill half of Titan's population. However, his people reject the idea and Thanos is subsequently ostracized. Over time, Thanos' prediction comes to pass, with him and Eros being the only surviving members.
Balancing the universe
Thanos, driven by his belief that the universe must be balanced by eliminating half of its population, embarks on conquests involving the killing of half of the planets' populations, becoming feared and powerful while taking control of various armies. He forges alliances with the Other and Ronan the Accuser, and adopts orphan children from planets he invades, including Gamora and Nebula, considering the former to be his favorite. Eventually, he decides to obtain the Infinity Stones after realizing he could use them to wipe out half of the life in the universe. He obtains the Mind Stone and places it in a scepter.
In 2012, Thanos directs the Other to form an alliance with Loki. Thanos provides Loki with the scepter and a Chitauri army to obtain the Space Stone within the Tesseract by conquering Earth. Following Loki's defeat by the Avengers and the loss of the Mind Stone, the Other reports the failed attack to Thanos. In 2014, Thanos locates the Power Stone and sends Ronan, Gamora, and Nebula to retrieve it. However, they betray him: Gamora joins the Guardians of the Galaxy, Ronan obtains the Power Stone and resolves to kill Thanos after destroying Xandar, while Nebula allies with Ronan. The Guardians of the Galaxy defeat Ronan and leave the Power Stone with the Nova Corps. In 2015, Thanos arrives on Nidavellir and forces the native Dwarves to forge the Infinity Gauntlet to hold all six Stones, planning to collect them himself.
The Blip and death
In 2018, Thanos and his children decimate Xandar to retrieve the Power Stone. Shortly after, they intercept a ship carrying Asgardian refugees following their world's destruction. Thanos kills half of them and incapacitates Thor. Loki attempts to exchange the Tesseract to save Thor, but betrays Thanos and is killed. Thanos then defeats the Hulk after being attacked by him, and obtains the Space Stone from the Tesseract. He orders his children to retrieve the Mind Stone and Time Stone from Earth before convening on Titan.
Thanos travels to Knowhere and obtains the Reality Stone from Taneleer Tivan. The Guardians of the Galaxy arrive to stop him, but Thanos uses the Stone to defeat them and captures Gamora. Forcing her to reveal the location of the Soul Stone, they travel to Vormir, where the Soul Stone's keeper, Johann Schmidt, informs them that the Soul Stone requires the sacrifice of a loved one. Thanos then sacrifices Gamora to obtain the Stone.
Arriving on Titan expecting to meet with one of his children, Thanos encounters Stephen Strange and learns his child is dead. Ambushed by Tony Stark, Peter Parker, and members of the Guardians of the Galaxy, a fight ensues. Thanos is briefly incapacitated by their efforts as they attempt to remove the Infinity Gauntlet. However, once Peter Quill learns Thanos killed Gamora, he attacks Thanos, causing him to break free and overpower them. He then prepares to kill Stark, until Strange offers the Time Stone in exchange for sparing Stark's life.
Three of Thanos' children plan an invasion of Wakanda to retrieve the Mind Stone from Vision, an android powered by the Stone, but fail after a battle ensues and they are killed by the Avengers. Thanos then teleports to Wakanda and encounters resistance from the Avengers and their allies. He makes his way to Vision, so Wanda Maximoff kills Vision in order to destroy the Mind Stone. However, Thanos uses the Time Stone to undo it and gains the Mind Stone, killing Vision. Placing it in his Gauntlet, Thanos is in possession of all six Stones. However, Thor's axe, Stormbreaker, impales him in his chest. Despite his pain, Thanos manages to snap his fingers, successfully decimating half of all life in the universe.
With his mission complete, he teleports to the Garden, where he rests. Twenty-three days later, Thanos is ambushed by surviving members of the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, along with Carol Danvers. They seek to reverse his actions and after learning that he has destroyed the Stones following the snap, Thor decapitates him.
Legacy within Earth-616
Thanos's actions have a universal impact, with the surviving Avengers working to mitigate the damage until undoing the Blip five years later in 2023. Maximoff is traumatized by Vision's death, causing her to have a mental breakdown and create a false reality.
Ajak, leader of the Eternals, informs Ikaris that the Blip delayed an apocalyptic event called the Emergence, saving many planets from destruction. However, when the Avengers reversed the Blip, the Emergence continued. Ajak feels the Earth should be saved and recruited the Eternals to stop the Emergence, doing so successfully.
The sudden return of the population has an impact as well, with the Global Repatriation Council (GRC) working to reintegrate the Blipped population. It led to socioeconomic conflicts, with entities like the Flag Smashers believing Thanos' ideas were correct. Feeling life was better during the Blip, they use terrorism against the GRC as they felt the GRC favored Blipped people more than the survivors. Moreover, the phrase "Thanos was right" is observed in popular human culture, being used in graffiti and merchandise for profit.
Battle at the Avengers Compound
In 2023, the surviving members of the Blip plan to use the Quantum Realm to time travel in order to retrieve the Stones. 2014-Thanos becomes aware of the Blip after the cybernetic implants of 2014-Nebula link to 2023-Nebula, revealing the latter's memories. Thanos has 2014-Nebula impersonate her future self and travel to 2023 so she can use the Quantum Realm to transport Thanos and his army there. The Avengers succeed in retrieving the Stones, with Stark creating a Nano Gauntlet to hold them in order to snap again to undo the Blip, with Bruce Banner doing so.
However, 2014-Thanos arrives within his warship and destroys the Avengers Compound. While his army searches for the Stones, Thanos engages in a fight with Stark, Steve Rogers, and Thor, during which he decides to destroy all life and repopulate it so that life would be grateful. Thanos defeats Stark and Thor, leaving only Rogers. He calls forth his armies, but the Avengers' restored allies arrive and engage Thanos and his army in a final battle. After a struggle, Thanos obtains the Stark Nano Gauntlet, but Stark distracts him to wield the Stones himself. Stark then snaps his fingers, causing Thanos and his army to be Blipped, which kills him.

### Concept and creation

Background and development
Main article: Thanos
Jim Starlin conceived Thanos during a college psychology course and introduced him as a villain in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (February 1973). Thanos was based on the Freudian concept of Thanatos, more commonly referred to as the death drive. Thanatos in Greek mythology was the personification of death and Thanos has been featured pursuing the female personification of Death. In the comics, Thanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the Titanian Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, and is able to demonstrate invulnerability and superhuman strength, speed, and stamina, among other qualities.
Casting and appearances
Thanos made his MCU debut in The Avengers (2012), in which Damion Poitier portrayed the character and was only credited as Man #1. It was Joss Whedon's idea to include Thanos in the film as his only instructions from Kevin Feige were that the film's villains should be aliens, and the rest was up to Whedon. In May 2014, Josh Brolin signed a multi-film contract to portray Thanos, debuting in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). Thanos was originally going to have a larger role in the film, but Whedon felt that the character needed to be introduced to the franchise gradually. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely stated that Thanos' previous appearances in the franchise helped legitimize him as a threat prior to Avengers: Infinity War (2018). Despite this, little screen time had been devoted to Thanos' history and motivations. Markus stated, "We don't get an element of surprise [with his introduction in Infinity War]... You can count on a lot of scenes where we illuminate a lot about him very early", with McFeely adding, "It is incumbent upon us to give him a real story, real stakes, real personality, and a real point of view".
Infinity War went through numerous story iterations, and over the course of development Thanos' presence in the film grew. VFX supervisor Dan DeLeeuw noted "Thanos went from supporting villain to one of the main characters driving the plot". In one draft, the film was told directly from Thanos' perspective with him serving as narrator. Exploring more of Thanos' backstory via flashbacks was considered at one point, but only concept art was created and no scenes were filmed involving a younger Thanos. Despite leading the cast in screen time in Infinity War and being considered the main character of the film by many, Thanos had a secondary role in Avengers: Endgame (2019). McFeely explained "we had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain [...] You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature". Joe Russo stated that after Thanos was successful in Infinity War, he is "done" and "retired". Since at the end of Infinity War Thanos had acquired the enormously powerful Infinity Stones, Markus and McFeely had difficulty deciding how to include him in the plot of Endgame until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act. Markus explained that the character's early death improved his agenda.
Footage of Thanos killing Loki in Infinity War is shown in a scene of the first episode of the Disney+ television series Loki where Loki sees what his future would have looked like if he hadn't used the Tesseract to escape after the Battle of New York in 2012, creating a branched timeline.
Characterization
Thanos' storyline in The Infinity Gauntlet (1991), which was one of the comics that influenced Infinity War, features his attempt to woo the female manifestation of Death. This plot was omitted from the films, as the filmmakers instead chose to pair the character with Gamora and focus on their father-daughter relationship. McFeely explained this choice by noting that Thanos and Gamora had a lot of history that they wanted to explore, which would add layers to Thanos to avoid him becoming "the big mustache-twisting bad guy who wants ultimate power just to take over the world and sit on a throne." Avoiding the Death storyline moved away from the tease Whedon used in The Avengers with the character, where Thanos felt that by challenging the Avengers, he was courting death. Though the tease was purposely ambiguous, Whedon felt when he featured Thanos, he did not know what to do with him, feeling that he hung Thanos out to dry. Whedon added that "I love Thanos. I love his apocalyptic vision, his love affair with death. I love his power. But, I don't really understand it". Whedon enjoyed the approach the writers and Russos took in Infinity War, giving Thanos "an actual perspective and [making] him feel righteous to himself", since the Death storyline would not necessarily translate well.
Even when not using the Infinity Stones, Thanos is shown to be a skilled physical fighter, defeating the Hulk in hand-to-hand combat in Infinity War and wielding a double-sided sword in combat in Endgame. Like the original comic book version of the character, Thanos in the MCU possesses superhuman strength, speed, and stamina.
Design and special effects
Digital Domain worked on creating Thanos for Infinity War and Endgame, producing over 400 visual effects shots. The company created a new facial capture application called Masquerade, based on the concept of machine learning through computer algorithms, specifically for the film, beginning work on the system 3â€“4 months before filming began to develop and test it. They presented their results to Brolin, the Russos, and executives from Marvel ahead of filming to demonstrate the subtleties Brolin would be able to bring to the character, which helped inform Brolin on how to portray Thanos. Masquerade improved the quality of facial capture and sped up turn around, but was limited as it required Brolin to deliver his performance in a seated capture position. Before the start of filming, Brolin's facial expressions were captured with ILM's Medusa system, which along with his motion capture data, were fed to Masquerade to "create a higher-resolution version of what Brolin did on set" so animators could apply that to the CGI character. At 8 feet, 3 inches tall, Thanos was made taller for his MCU appearances than he was portrayed as being in the comics. Digital Design considered having "snap" briefly pop up on screen when Thanos snapped his fingers as a reference to how the snap occurred in the Infinity Gauntlet comic. Digital Domain's VFX Supervisor Kelly Port said "as a fun aside, we explored the idea of lifting the actual graphic from the frame of the comic showing the snap, the little yellow action triangles for a single frame of the moment of the snap. They appreciated the idea but didn't ultimately go for it".
Physical appearance changes
Thanos' design changed drastically between his first appearance in The Avengers and his larger role in Infinity War. With Brolin's first appearance in Guardians of the Galaxy, motion capture technology was used to capture Brolin's facial features, with Thanos' skin also being changed to a darker shade of purple than it had been in The Avengers. Advancements in CGI and motion capture technology allowed for the use of more of Brolin's features in Infinity War and Endgame. The shade of purple for Thanos' skin was changed again for the films, now becoming lighter. In earlier appearances, Thanos had four scars on his cheeks and eleven lines on his chin, but the number of scars was reduced to three and the number of chin lines was reduced to nine with his Infinity War design update. The design of Thanos took into account the versions that appeared in previous films but were adjusted more towards Brolin's features, which also helped with matching his performance to the digital character.
Portrayal
Brolin's portrayal of Thanos was inspired by Marlon Brando's performance as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979). In an interview in October 2020, Brolin said "[Kurtz] is very elusive and insane but what he is saying makes sense and is poetical ... I started seeing the parallel which I liked for me. I loved being able to resort to a film like Apocalypse Now when I was doing something like Avengers".
