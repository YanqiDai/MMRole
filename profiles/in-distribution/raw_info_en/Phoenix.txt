Jean Grey is a fictional character featured in seven films in the X-Men film series, starting with X-Men (2000) and ending with Dark Phoenix (2019), based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Jean was portrayed by Dutch actress Famke Janssen in five films, with "Jean" in The Wolverine (2013) being a posthumous hallucination in Logan's head and her appearance in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) being a brief flashforward scene. For the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse, Jean was recast with English actress Sophie Turner, who would reprise her role in Dark Phoenix in 2019.

### Fictional character biography

Early life
X-Men: The Last Stand and Dark Phoenix each has a flashback sequence for Jean; because of the events of X-Men: Days of Future Past, these two flashbacks takes place in two different realities.
In the original timeline, Jean is visited by Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lehnsherr (Ian McKellen) after her parents had been concerned about what they believed to be a type of "illness" in their daughter. The girl is shown levitating multiple cars and other objects with her telekinetic powers and the two elder mutants, still friends at the time, invite Jean to the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. The professor later explains that while she was young, he put psychic dampers on her mind to help control a supposed "dark side" within her subconscious, preventing her powers from spiraling out of control and hurting others and herself.[P 1]
In the second timeline, Jean is in a car with her parents, causing a car crash with her out-of-control mental powers, killing her mother and leaving her father afraid of his own daughter and refusing to see her later on; Jean is led to believe that her father also died in the crash. She is approached by Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), who tries to help the troubled girl, inviting her to enroll in his school.[P 2]
X-Men films
Throughout the films X-Men (2000), X2, and X-Men: The Last Stand, Jean serves as a member of the X-Men until she was possessed by the Phoenix Force and eventually killed by Wolverine. Additionally, she makes minor appearances in The Wolverine, in which his guilt over killing her haunts the titular character, and X-Men: Days of Future Past, in which she was revived after the X-Men averted a post-apocalyptic future. In the films X-Men: Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix, the second incarnation of Grey (portrayed by Sophie Turner) joins the X-Men to fight Apocalypse, before sacrificing herself to use the Phoenix Force's power to defeat the D'Bari.

### Characterization and special effects

In X-Men: The Last Stand, Jean's appearance when the Phoenix takes control was created by John Bruno working with Moving Picture Company. MPC used particle systems to create the effect of Jean's hair seemingly moving when the Phoenix effect takes over. MPC made hundreds of skin and eye treatments and used a 3D model of Famke Janssen's face when compositing them into Jean's digital makeup. According to Nicolas Aithadi (MPC),
The idea was that when the Dark Phoenix is taking over, Jean's skin darkens, veining appears on her face, and her eyes go black. We went through hundreds of iterations with different degrees of darkness, with more or fewer visible veins. At the end, we went for a 'less is more' look and made the effect more subtle - but still enough to give Jean a scary look.
