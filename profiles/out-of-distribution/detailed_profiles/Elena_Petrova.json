Interpersonally, she communicates with a directness softened by genuine empathy, earning both respect and trust from those around her.",

Born into a modest family in Moscow, she developed an early interest in global affairs, inspired by her grandfather's stories from his time as a journalist. Her path was not without challenges; facing the constraints of her then-Soviet environment, she pursued her passion for journalism with unwavering determination. \nElena’s break came with her coverage of the Afghan conflict in the late 1980s, gaining her international recognition. This set the stage for a career defined by frontline reporting in the Balkans, the Middle East, and Africa. Through her books and films, Elena has shed light on the human aspect of conflicts, focusing on the resilience of individuals amidst despair.\nHer personal life, though rich with the connections made through her travels, has seen its share of sacrifices.
