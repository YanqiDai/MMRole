# *MMRole*: A Comprehensive Framework for Developing and Evaluating Multimodal Role-Playing Agents

![](assets/mmrole.png)

Multimodal Role-Playing Agents (MRPAs) are designed to emulate specific characters and engage in dialogues centered around images, with either human users or other characters.
*MMRole* is a comprehensive framework for developing and evaluating MRPAs, which comprises a personalized multimodal dataset and a robust evaluation method.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale, high-quality dataset, *MMRole-Data*, consisting of 85 characters, 11K images, and 14K single or multi-turn dialogues.
Additionally, we present a robust evaluation method, *MMRole-Eval*, encompassing eight metrics across three dimensions, where a reward model is trained to score MRPAs with the constructed ground-truth data for comparison.
Please refer to our paper for more details (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04203).

## *MMRole-Data*: Multimodal Role-Playing Dataset

![](assets/dialogues.png)

Statistically, the *MMRole-Data* dataset comprises 85 characters, 11,032 images, and 14,346 dialogues, yielding 85,456 training samples and 294 test samples. 

## *MMRole-Eval*: Multimodal Role-Playing Evaluation

We propose *MMRole-Eval*, a robust evaluation method to stably and comprehensively assess MRPAs, which comprises eight metrics across three dimensions: fundamental conversational skills, multimodal understanding abilities, and role-playing qualities.
For each metric, a specialized reward model initially conduct a brief qualitative assessment of the relative performance between the evaluated MRPA and the constructed ground-truth data, followed by assigning a quantitative score pair.
The final score of the MRPA is the ratio of the two scores within the score pair.
To develop the reward model, we employ GPT-4 to assess various MRPAs and leverage the evaluation trajectories to train our reward model.

We develop the first specialized MRPA, *MMRole-Agent*, using the training data of *MMRole-Data*.
Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the improved performance of *MMRole-Agent*, and highlight the primary challenges in developing MRPAs, emphasizing the need for enhanced multimodal understanding and role-playing consistency.
