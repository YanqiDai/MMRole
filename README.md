# *MMRole*: A Comprehensive Framework for Developing and Evaluating Multimodal Role-Playing Agents

Multimodal Role-Playing Agents (MRPAs) are designed to emulate specific characters and engage in dialogues centered around images, with either human users or other characters.
*MMRole* is a comprehensive framework for developing and evaluating MRPAs, which comprises a personalized multimodal dataset and a robust evaluation method.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale, high-quality dataset, *MMRole-Data*, consisting of 85 characters, 11K images, and 14K single or multi-turn dialogues.
Additionally, we present a robust evaluation method, *MMRole-Eval*, encompassing eight metrics across three dimensions, where a reward model is trained to score MRPAs with the constructed ground-truth data for comparison.
Evaluation results demonstrate the improved performance of the first specialized MRPA, *MMRole-Agent*, and highlight the primary challenges in developing MRPAs, emphasizing the need for enhanced multimodal understanding and role-playing consistency.
